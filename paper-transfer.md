# Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision

## Abstract

State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at <https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP>.

## Introduction and Motivating Work

Pre-training methods which learn directly from raw text have revolutionized NLP over the last few years (Dai & Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2019). Task-agnostic objectives such as autoregressive and masked language modeling have scaled across many orders of magnitude in compute, model capacity, and data, steadily improving capabilities. The development of “text-to-text” as a standardized input-output interface (McCann et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019) has enabled taskagnostic architectures to zero-shot transfer to downstream datasets removing the need for specialized output heads or dataset specific customization. Flagship systems like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) are now competitive across many tasks with bespoke models while requiring little to no dataset specific training data.

These results suggest that the aggregate supervision accessible to modern pre-training methods within web-scale collections of text surpasses that of high-quality crowd-labeled NLP datasets. However, in other fields such as computer vision it is still standard practice to pre-train models on crowd-labeled datasets such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Could scalable pre-training methods which learn directly from web text result in a similar breakthrough in computer vision? Prior work is encouraging.

Over 20 years ago Mori et al. (1999) explored improving content based image retrieval by training a model to predict the nouns and adjectives in text documents paired with images. Quattoni et al. (2007) demonstrated it was possible to learn more data efficient image representations via manifold learning in the weight space of classifiers trained to predict words in captions associated with images. Srivastava & Salakhutdinov (2012) explored deep representation learning by training multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machines on top of low-level image and text tag features. Joulin et al. (2016) modernized this line of work and demonstrated that CNNs trained to predict words in image captions learn useful image representations. They converted the title, description, and hashtag metadata of images in the YFCC100M dataset (Thomee et al., 2016) into a bag-ofwords multi-label classification task and showed that pretraining AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) to predict these labels learned representations which preformed similarly to ImageNet-based pre-training on transfer tasks. Li et al. (2017) then extended this approach to predicting phrase ngrams in addition to individual words and demonstrated the ability of their system to zero-shot transfer to other image classification datasets by scoring target classes based on their dictionary of learned visual n-grams and predicting the one with the highest score. Adopting more recent architectures and pre-training approaches, VirTex (Desai & Johnson, 2020), ICMLM (Bulent Sariyildiz et al., 2020), and ConVIRT (Zhang et al., 2020) have recently demonstrated the potential of transformer-based language modeling, masked language modeling, and contrastive objectives to learn image representations from text.

While exciting as proofs of concept, using natural language supervision for image representation learning is still rare. This is likely because demonstrated performance on common benchmarks is much lower than alternative approaches. For example, Li et al. (2017) reach only 11.5% accuracy on ImageNet in a zero-shot setting. This is well below the 88.4% accuracy of the current state of the art (Xie et al., 2020). It is even below the 50% accuracy of classic computer vision approaches (Deng et al., 2012). Instead, more narrowly scoped but well-targeted uses of weak supervision have improved performance. Mahajan et al. (2018) showed that predicting ImageNet-related hashtags on Instagram images is an effective pre-training task. When fine-tuned to ImageNet these pre-trained models increased accuracy by over 5% and improved the overall state of the art at the time. Kolesnikov et al. (2019) and Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) have also demonstrated large gains on a broader set of transfer benchmarks by pre-training models to predict the classes of the noisily labeled JFT-300M dataset.

This line of work represents the current pragmatic middle ground between learning from a limited amount of supervised “gold-labels” and learning from practically unlimited amounts of raw text. However, it is not without compromises. Both works carefully design, and in the process limit, their supervision to 1000 and 18291 classes respectively. Natural language is able to express, and therefore supervise, a much wider set of visual concepts through its generality. Both approaches also use static softmax classifiers to perform prediction and lack a mechanism for dynamic outputs. This severely curtails their flexibility and limits their “zero-shot” capabilities.

A crucial difference between these weakly supervised models and recent explorations of learning image representations directly from natural language is scale. While Mahajan et al. (2018) and Kolesnikov et al. (2019) trained their models for accelerator years on millions to billions of images, VirTex, ICMLM, and ConVIRT trained for accelerator days on one to two hundred thousand images. In this work, we close this gap and study the behaviors of image classifiers trained with natural language supervision at large scale. Enabled by the large amounts of publicly available data of this form on the internet, we create a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs and demonstrate that a simplified version of ConVIRT trained from scratch, which we call CLIP, for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, is an efficient method of learning from natural language supervision. We study the scalability of CLIP by training a series of eight models spanning almost 2 orders of magnitude of compute and observe that transfer performance is a smoothly predictable function of compute (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020). We find that CLIP, similar to the GPT family, learns to perform a wide set of tasks during pre-training including OCR, geo-localization, action recognition, and many others. We measure this by benchmarking the zero-shot transfer performance of CLIP on over 30 existing datasets and find it can be competitive with prior task-specific supervised models. We also confirm these findings with linear-probe representation learning analysis and show that CLIP outperforms the best publicly available ImageNet model while also being more computationally efficient. We additionally find that zero-shot CLIP models are much more robust than equivalent accuracy supervised ImageNet models which suggests that zero-shot evaluation of task-agnostic models is much more representative of a model’s capability. These results have significant policy and ethical implications, which we consider in Section 7.

## Approach

### Natural Language Supervision

At the core of our approach is the idea of learning perception from supervision contained in natural language. As discussed in the introduction, this is not at all a new idea, however terminology used to describe work in this space is varied, even seemingly contradictory, and stated motivations are diverse. Zhang et al. (2020), Gomez et al. (2017), Joulin et al. (2016), and Desai & Johnson (2020) all introduce methods which learn visual representations from text paired with images but describe their approaches as unsupervised, self-supervised, weakly supervised, and supervised respectively.

We emphasize that what is common across this line of work is not any of the details of the particular methods used but the appreciation of natural language as a training signal. All these approaches are learning from natural language supervision. Although early work wrestled with the complexity of natural language when using topic model and n-gram representations, improvements in deep contextual representation learning suggest we now have the tools to effectively leverage this abundant source of supervision (McCann et al., 2017).

Learning from natural language has several potential strengths over other training methods. It’s much easier to scale natural language supervision compared to standard crowd-sourced labeling for image classification since it does not require annotations to be in a classic “machine learning compatible format” such as the canonical 1-of-N majority vote “gold label”. Instead, methods which work on natural language can learn passively from the supervision contained in the vast amount of text on the internet. Learning from natural language also has an important advantage over most unsupervised or self-supervised learning approaches in that it doesn’t “just” learn a representation but also connects that representation to language which enables flexible zero-shot transfer. In the following subsections, we detail the specific approach we settled on.

저희 접근 방식의 핵심은 자연어에 포함된 슈퍼비전을 통해 인식을 학습한다는 아이디어입니다. 서론에서 설명했듯이 이것은 전혀 새로운 아이디어는 아니지만, 이 분야의 작업을 설명하는 데 사용되는 용어는 다양하고 심지어 모순적으로 보이며, 명시된 동기도 다양합니다. Zhang 등(2020), Gomez 등(2017), Joulin 등(2016), Desai & Johnson(2020)은 모두 이미지와 짝을 이룬 텍스트로부터 시각적 표현을 학습하는 방법을 소개하지만 그 접근 방식을 각각 무감독, 자기 감독, 약한 감독, 감독으로 설명합니다.

이러한 일련의 작업에서 공통적으로 강조하는 것은 사용된 특정 방법의 세부 사항이 아니라 자연어를 훈련 신호로 인식한다는 점입니다. 이러한 모든 접근 방식은 자연어 감독을 통해 학습합니다. 초기 연구에서는 토픽 모델과 n-그램 표현을 사용할 때 자연어의 복잡성과 씨름했지만, 심층 문맥 표현 학습의 개선으로 이제 이 풍부한 감독 소스를 효과적으로 활용할 수 있는 도구를 갖추게 되었습니다(McCann et al., 2017).

자연어를 통한 학습은 다른 학습 방법에 비해 몇 가지 잠재적인 강점이 있습니다. 이미지 분류를 위한 표준 크라우드 소스 라벨링에 비해 자연어 감독을 확장하기가 훨씬 쉬우며, 주석이 일반적인 '머신 러닝 호환 형식'인 N분의 1 다수결 '골드 라벨'이 아니어도 되기 때문입니다. 대신 자연어에서 작동하는 방법은 인터넷의 방대한 양의 텍스트에 포함된 감독을 통해 수동적으로 학습할 수 있습니다. 또한 자연어 학습은 대부분의 비지도 또는 자가 지도 학습 접근 방식에 비해 표현을 '단순히' 학습하는 것이 아니라 그 표현을 언어와 연결하여 유연한 제로 샷 전송을 가능하게 한다는 점에서 중요한 이점이 있습니다. 다음 하위 섹션에서는 우리가 결정한 구체적인 접근 방식에 대해 자세히 설명합니다.

### Creating a Sufficiently Large Dataset

Existing work has mainly used three datasets, MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014), Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017), and YFCC100M (Thomee et al., 2016). While MS-COCO and Visual Genome are high quality crowd-labeled datasets, they are small by modern standards with approximately 100,000 training photos each. By comparison, other computer vision systems are trained on up to 3.5 billion Instagram photos (Mahajan et al., 2018). YFCC100M, at 100 million photos, is a possible alternative, but the metadata for each image is sparse and of varying quality. Many images use automatically generated filenames like 20160716 113957.JPG as “titles” or contain “descriptions” of camera exposure settings. After filtering to keep only images with natural language titles and/or descriptions in English, the dataset shrunk by a factor of 6 to only 15 million photos. This is approximately the same size as ImageNet.

A major motivation for natural language supervision is the large quantities of data of this form available publicly on the internet. Since existing datasets do not adequately reflect this possibility, considering results only on them would underestimate the potential of this line of research. To address this, we constructed a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected form a variety of publicly available sources on the Internet. To attempt to cover as broad a set of visual concepts as possible, we search for (image, text) pairs as part of the construction process whose text includes one of a set of 500,000 queries.1 We approximately class balance the results by including up to 20,000 (image, text) pairs per query. The resulting dataset has a similar total word count as the WebText dataset used to train GPT-2. We refer to this dataset as WIT for WebImageText.

기존 연구에서는 주로 MS-COCO(Lin et al., 2014), Visual Genome(Krishna et al., 2017), YFCC100M(Thomee et al., 2016)의 세 가지 데이터 세트를 사용했습니다. MS-COCO와 Visual Genome은 고품질의 크라우드 라벨링 데이터 세트이지만, 각각 약 10만 장의 훈련 사진으로 최신 기준으로는 규모가 작습니다. 이에 비해 다른 컴퓨터 비전 시스템은 최대 35억 장의 Instagram 사진으로 학습합니다(Mahajan et al., 2018). 1억 장의 사진으로 구성된 YFCC100M도 대안이 될 수 있지만, 각 이미지의 메타데이터가 드물고 품질이 다양합니다. 많은 이미지가 20160716 113957.jpg와 같이 자동으로 생성된 파일명을 '제목'으로 사용하거나 카메라 노출 설정에 대한 '설명'을 포함하고 있습니다. 자연어 제목 및/또는 설명이 영어로 된 이미지만 유지하도록 필터링한 후, 데이터 세트는 6배나 줄어든 1,500만 장의 사진으로 축소되었습니다. 이는 ImageNet과 거의 같은 크기입니다.

자연어 수퍼비전의 주요 동기는 이러한 형태의 데이터가 인터넷에서 공개적으로 사용 가능하다는 점입니다. 기존 데이터 세트는 이러한 가능성을 적절히 반영하지 못하기 때문에, 그 결과만을 고려하면 이 연구 분야의 잠재력을 과소평가할 수 있습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 인터넷에서 공개적으로 이용 가능한 다양한 출처에서 수집한 4억 쌍(이미지, 텍스트)의 새로운 데이터 세트를 구축했습니다. 가능한 한 광범위한 시각적 개념을 포괄하기 위해 구축 과정의 일부로 텍스트가 50만 개의 쿼리 세트 중 하나를 포함하는 (이미지, 텍스트) 쌍을 검색했습니다.1 쿼리당 최대 2만 개의 (이미지, 텍스트) 쌍을 포함하여 결과의 클래스 밸런스를 대략적으로 맞췄습니다. 결과 데이터 세트의 총 단어 수는 GPT-2 훈련에 사용된 웹 텍스트 데이터 세트와 비슷합니다. 우리는 이 데이터 세트를 WebImageText용 WIT라고 부릅니다.

### Selecting an Efficient Pre-Training Method

State-of-the-art computer vision systems use very large amounts of compute. Mahajan et al. (2018) required 19 GPU years to train their ResNeXt101-32x48d and Xie et al. (2020) required 33 TPUv3 core-years to train their Noisy Student EfficientNet-L2. When considering that both these systems were trained to predict only 1000 ImageNet classes, the task of learning an open set of visual concepts from natural language seems daunting. In the course of our efforts, we found training efficiency was key to successfully scaling natural language supervision and we selected our final pre-training method based on this metric.

Our initial approach, similar to VirTex, jointly trained an image CNN and text transformer from scratch to predict the caption of an image. However, we encountered difficulties efficiently scaling this method. In Figure 2 we show that a 63 million parameter transformer language model, which already uses twice the compute of its ResNet-50 image encoder, learns to recognize ImageNet classes three times slower than a much simpler baseline that predicts a bag-ofwords encoding of the same text.

Both these approaches share a key similarity. They try to predict the exact words of the text accompanying each image. This is a difficult task due to the wide variety of descriptions, comments, and related text that co-occur with images. Recent work in contrastive representation learning for images has found that contrastive objectives can learn better representations than their equivalent predictive objective (Tian et al., 2019). Other work has found that although generative models of images can learn high quality image representations, they require over an order of magnitude more compute than contrastive models with the same performance (Chen et al., 2020a). Noting these findings, we explored training a system to solve the potentially easier proxy task of predicting only which text as a whole is paired with which image and not the exact words of that text. Starting with the same bag-of-words encoding baseline, we swapped the predictive objective for a contrastive objective in Figure 2 and observed a further 4x efficiency improvement in the rate of zero-shot transfer to ImageNet.

Given a batch of N (image, text) pairs, CLIP is trained to predict which of the N × N possible (image, text) pairings across a batch actually occurred. To do this, CLIP learns a multi-modal embedding space by jointly training an image encoder and text encoder to maximize the cosine similarity of the image and text embeddings of the N real pairs in the batch while minimizing the cosine similarity of the embeddings of the N2 − N incorrect pairings. We optimize a symmetric cross entropy loss over these similarity scores. In Figure 3 we include pseudocode of the core of an implementation of CLIP. To our knowledge this batch construction technique and objective was first introduced in the area of deep metric learning as the multi-class N-pair loss Sohn (2016), was popularized for contrastive representation learning by Oord et al. (2018) as the InfoNCE loss, and was recently adapted for contrastive (text, image) representation learning in the domain of medical imaging by Zhang et al. (2020).

Due to the large size of our pre-training dataset, over-fitting is not a major concern and the details of training CLIP are simplified compared to the implementation of Zhang et al. (2020). We train CLIP from scratch without initializing the image encoder with ImageNet weights or the text encoder with pre-trained weights. We do not use the non-linear projection between the representation and the contrastive embedding space, a change which was introduced by Bachman et al. (2019) and popularized by Chen et al. (2020b). We instead use only a linear projection to map from each encoder’s representation to the multi-modal embedding space. We did not notice a difference in training efficiency between the two versions and speculate that non-linear projections may be co-adapted with details of current image only in self-supervised representation learning methods. We also remove the text transformation function tu from Zhang et al. (2020) which samples a single sentence at uniform from the text since many of the (image, text) pairs in CLIP’s pretraining dataset are only a single sentence. We also simplify the image transformation function tv. A random square crop from resized images is the only data augmentation used during training. Finally, the temperature parameter which controls the range of the logits in the softmax, τ , is directly optimized during training as a log-parameterized multiplicative scalar to avoid turning as a hyper-parameter.

최첨단 컴퓨터 비전 시스템은 매우 많은 양의 컴퓨팅을 사용합니다. Mahajan 등(2018)은 ResNeXt101-32x48d를 훈련하는 데 19 GPU 년이 필요했고, Xie 등(2020)은 노이즈가 많은 학생 EfficientNet-L2를 훈련하는 데 33 TPUv3 코어 년이 필요했습니다. 이 두 시스템이 1000개의 ImageNet 클래스만 예측하도록 훈련되었다는 점을 고려하면, 자연어에서 개방형 시각 개념 세트를 학습하는 작업은 벅차 보입니다. 노력하는 과정에서 훈련 효율성이 자연어 감독을 성공적으로 확장하는 데 핵심이라는 사실을 알게 되었고, 이 지표를 기반으로 최종 사전 훈련 방법을 선택했습니다.

VirTex와 유사한 초기 접근 방식은 이미지의 캡션을 예측하기 위해 이미지 CNN과 텍스트 트랜스포머를 처음부터 공동으로 학습시켰습니다. 하지만 이 방법을 효율적으로 확장하는 데 어려움을 겪었습니다. 그림 2에서는 이미 ResNet-50 이미지 인코더의 두 배에 달하는 연산량을 사용하는 6,300만 개의 파라미터 트랜스포머 언어 모델이 동일한 텍스트의 단어 모음 인코딩을 예측하는 훨씬 간단한 기준선보다 3배 느리게 ImageNet 클래스를 인식하는 법을 학습하는 것을 보여줍니다.

이 두 가지 접근 방식은 중요한 유사점을 공유합니다. 이들은 각 이미지와 함께 제공되는 텍스트의 정확한 단어를 예측하려고 합니다. 이미지와 함께 제공되는 설명, 주석, 관련 텍스트가 매우 다양하기 때문에 이는 어려운 작업입니다. 이미지에 대한 대조적 표현 학습에 대한 최근 연구에 따르면 대조적 목표가 동등한 예측 목표보다 더 나은 표현을 학습할 수 있다는 사실이 밝혀졌습니다(Tian et al., 2019). 다른 연구에서는 이미지의 생성 모델이 고품질 이미지 표현을 학습할 수 있지만, 동일한 성능을 가진 대조 모델보다 훨씬 더 많은 컴퓨팅을 필요로 한다는 사실을 발견했습니다(Chen et al., 2020a). 이러한 결과에 주목하여, 우리는 텍스트의 정확한 단어가 아닌 전체 텍스트가 어떤 이미지와 짝을 이루는지만 예측하는 잠재적으로 더 쉬운 대리 작업을 해결하기 위해 시스템을 훈련시키는 방법을 모색했습니다. 동일한 단어 묶음 인코딩 기준선에서 시작하여 그림 2의 예측 목표를 대조 목표로 바꾼 결과, 이미지넷으로의 제로 샷 전송률이 4배 이상 향상되는 것을 관찰했습니다.

N(이미지, 텍스트) 쌍의 배치가 주어지면 CLIP은 배치에서 가능한 N × N(이미지, 텍스트) 쌍 중 어떤 것이 실제로 발생했는지 예측하도록 훈련됩니다. 이를 위해 CLIP은 이미지 인코더와 텍스트 인코더를 공동으로 훈련하여 배치에 포함된 N개의 실제 쌍의 이미지와 텍스트 임베딩의 코사인 유사도를 최대화하는 동시에 N2 - N개의 잘못된 쌍의 임베딩의 코사인 유사도를 최소화함으로써 멀티 모달 임베딩 공간을 학습합니다. 이러한 유사성 점수에 대해 대칭 교차 엔트로피 손실을 최적화합니다. 그림 3에는 CLIP 구현의 핵심에 대한 의사 코드가 포함되어 있습니다. 우리가 아는 바로는 이 배치 구성 기법과 목적은 딥 메트릭 학습 영역에서 멀티 클래스 N-쌍 손실 Sohn(2016)에 의해 처음 소개되었고, Oord 등(2018)에 의해 대조적 표현 학습에 InfoNCE 손실로 대중화되었으며, 최근에는 Zhang 등(2020)에 의해 의료 영상 영역에서 대조적(텍스트, 이미지) 표현 학습에 적용되었습니다.

사전 훈련 데이터 세트의 크기가 크기 때문에 과적합은 큰 문제가 되지 않으며, Zhang 등(2020)의 구현에 비해 CLIP 훈련의 세부 사항이 간소화되었습니다. 이미지 인코더를 이미지넷 가중치로 초기화하거나 텍스트 인코더를 사전 훈련된 가중치로 초기화하지 않고 처음부터 CLIP을 훈련합니다. 우리는 표현과 대비 임베딩 공간 사이에 비선형 투영을 사용하지 않는데, 이는 Bachman 등(2019)이 도입하고 Chen 등(2020b)이 대중화시킨 변경 사항입니다. 대신 각 인코더의 표현에서 멀티 모달 임베딩 공간으로 매핑할 때 선형 투영만 사용합니다. 두 버전 간의 훈련 효율성에 차이가 없었으며, 비선형 투영은 자기 지도 표현 학습 방법에서만 현재 이미지의 세부 사항과 함께 적용될 수 있을 것으로 추측합니다. 또한 CLIP의 사전 훈련 데이터 세트의 많은 (이미지, 텍스트) 쌍이 단일 문장으로만 구성되어 있기 때문에 텍스트에서 단일 문장을 균일하게 샘플링하는 Zhang 등(2020)의 텍스트 변환 함수 tu를 제거했습니다. 또한 이미지 변환 기능인 tv도 단순화했습니다. 크기가 조정된 이미지에서 무작위 정사각형 자르기가 훈련 중에 사용되는 유일한 데이터 증강입니다. 마지막으로, 소프트맥스에서 로그의 범위를 제어하는 온도 파라미터인 τ는 하이퍼 파라미터로 변하는 것을 방지하기 위해 로그 파라미터화된 곱셈 스칼라로 훈련 중에 직접 최적화됩니다.

### Choosing and Scaling a Model

We consider two different architectures for the image encoder. For the first, we use ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016a) as the base architecture for the image encoder due to its widespread adoption and proven performance. We make several modifications to the original version using the ResNetD improvements from He et al. (2019) and the antialiased rect-2 blur pooling from Zhang (2019). We also replace the global average pooling layer with an attention pooling mechanism. The attention pooling is implemented as a single layer of “transformer-style” multi-head QKV attention where the query is conditioned on the global average-pooled representation of the image. For the second architecture, we experiment with the recently introduced Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). We closely follow their implementation with only the minor modification of adding an additional layer normalization to the combined patch and position embeddings before the transformer and use a slightly different initialization scheme.

The text encoder is a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with the architecture modifications described in Radford et al. (2019). As a base size we use a 63M-parameter 12- layer 512-wide model with 8 attention heads. The transformer operates on a lower-cased byte pair encoding (BPE) representation of the text with a 49,152 vocab size (Sennrich et al., 2015). For computational efficiency, the max sequence length was capped at 76. The text sequence is bracketed with [SOS] and [EOS] tokens and the activations of the highest layer of the transformer at the [EOS] token are treated as the feature representation of the text which is layer normalized and then linearly projected into the multi-modal embedding space. Masked self-attention was used in the text encoder to preserve the ability to initialize with a pre-trained language model or add language modeling as an auxiliary objective, though exploration of this is left as future work.

While previous computer vision research has often scaled models by increasing the width (Mahajan et al., 2018) or depth (He et al., 2016a) in isolation, for the ResNet image encoders we adapt the approach of Tan & Le (2019) which found that allocating additional compute across all of width, depth, and resolution outperforms only allocating it to only one dimension of the model. While Tan & Le (2019) tune the ratio of compute allocated to each dimension for their EfficientNet architecture, we use a simple baseline of allocating additional compute equally to increasing the width, depth, and resolution of the model. For the text encoder, we only scale the width of the model to be proportional to the calculated increase in width of the ResNet and do not scale the depth at all, as we found CLIP’s performance to be less sensitive to the capacity of the text encoder.

이미지 인코더에는 두 가지 아키텍처를 고려합니다. 첫 번째는 널리 채택되고 성능이 입증된 ResNet-50(He et al., 2016a)을 이미지 인코더의 기본 아키텍처로 사용합니다. He et al.(2019)의 ResNetD 개선 사항과 Zhang(2019)의 앤티앨리어싱 렉트-2 블러 풀링을 사용하여 원본 버전을 몇 가지 수정했습니다. 또한 글로벌 평균 풀링 레이어를 관심 풀링 메커니즘으로 대체했습니다. 주의 풀링은 쿼리가 이미지의 글로벌 평균 풀링 표현에 따라 조절되는 "트랜스포머 스타일" 다중 헤드 QKV 주의의 단일 계층으로 구현됩니다. 두 번째 아키텍처의 경우, 최근에 도입된 비전 트랜스포머(ViT)를 실험합니다(Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). 우리는 트랜스포머 앞에 결합된 패치와 위치 임베딩에 추가 레이어 정규화를 추가하고 약간 다른 초기화 체계를 사용하는 약간의 수정만으로 그들의 구현을 면밀히 따릅니다.

텍스트 인코더는 Radford 외(2019)에서 설명한 아키텍처를 수정한 트랜스포머(Vaswani 외., 2017)입니다. 기본 크기로는 8개의 주의 헤드를 가진 63M 파라미터 12-레이어 512-폭 모델을 사용합니다. 트랜스포머는 49,152개의 어휘 크기를 가진 텍스트의 소문자 바이트 쌍 인코딩(BPE) 표현에서 작동합니다(Sennrich et al., 2015). 계산 효율성을 위해 최대 시퀀스 길이는 76으로 제한되었습니다. 텍스트 시퀀스는 [SOS] 및 [EOS] 토큰으로 괄호로 묶여 있으며, [EOS] 토큰에서 가장 높은 변환기 계층의 활성화는 텍스트의 특징 표현으로 처리되어 계층 정규화된 다음 다중 모드 임베딩 공간에 선형적으로 투영됩니다. 텍스트 인코더에는 사전 학습된 언어 모델로 초기화하거나 보조 목적으로 언어 모델링을 추가하는 기능을 유지하기 위해 마스크된 자기 주의가 사용되었지만, 이에 대한 탐색은 향후 작업으로 남겨져 있습니다.

이전의 컴퓨터 비전 연구에서는 종종 너비(Mahajan et al., 2018) 또는 깊이(He et al., 2016a)를 개별적으로 증가시켜 모델을 확장했지만, ResNet 이미지 인코더에서는 폭, 깊이, 해상도 모두에 추가 컴퓨팅을 할당하는 것이 모델의 한 차원에만 할당하는 것보다 성능이 더 우수하다는 Tan & Le(2019)의 접근 방식을 채택했습니다. Tan & Le(2019)는 각 차원에 할당되는 컴퓨팅 비율을 EfficientNet 아키텍처에 맞게 조정하지만, 저희는 추가 컴퓨팅을 모델의 폭, 깊이, 해상도 증가에 동일하게 할당하는 간단한 기준을 사용합니다. 텍스트 인코더의 경우, CLIP의 성능이 텍스트 인코더의 용량에 덜 민감하다는 것을 발견했기 때문에 모델의 너비만 계산된 ResNet의 너비 증가에 비례하도록 스케일링하고 깊이는 전혀 스케일링하지 않습니다.

### Training

We train a series of 5 ResNets and 3 Vision Transformers. For the ResNets we train a ResNet-50, a ResNet-101, and then 3 more which follow EfficientNet-style model scaling and use approximately 4x, 16x, and 64x the compute of a ResNet-50. They are denoted as RN50x4, RN50x16, and RN50x64 respectively. For the Vision Transformers we train a ViT-B/32, a ViT-B/16, and a ViT-L/14. We train all models for 32 epochs. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with decoupled weight decay regularization (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) applied to all weights that are not gains or biases, and decay the learning rate using a cosine schedule (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016). Initial hyperparameters were set using a combination of grid searches, random search, and manual tuning on the baseline ResNet50 model when trained for 1 epoch. Hyper-parameters were then adapted heuristically for larger models due to computational constraints. The learnable temperature parameter τ was initialized to the equivalent of 0.07 from (Wu et al., 2018) and clipped to prevent scaling the logits by more than 100 which we found necessary to prevent training instability. We use a very large minibatch size of 32,768. Mixed-precision (Micikevicius et al., 2017) was used to accelerate training and save memory. To save additional memory, gradient checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016), half-precision Adam statistics (Dhariwal et al., 2020), and half-precision stochastically rounded text encoder weights were used. The calculation of embedding similarities was also sharded with individual GPUs computing only the subset of the pairwise similarities necessary for their local batch of embeddings. The largest ResNet model, RN50x64, took 18 days to train on 592 V100 GPUs while the largest Vision Transformer took 12 days on 256 V100 GPUs. For the ViT-L/14 we also pre-train at a higher 336 pixel resolution for one additional epoch to boost performance similar to FixRes (Touvron et al., 2019). We denote this model as ViT-L/14@336px. Unless otherwise specified, all results reported in this paper as “CLIP” use this model which we found to perform best.

5개의 ResNet과 3개의 비전 트랜스포머를 차례로 훈련합니다. 레스넷의 경우 레스넷-50, 레스넷-101, 그리고 EfficientNet 스타일의 모델 스케일링을 따르고 레스넷-50의 약 4배, 16배, 64배의 연산량을 사용하는 3개의 레스넷을 추가로 훈련합니다. 각각 RN50x4, RN50x16, RN50x64로 표시됩니다. 비전 트랜스포머의 경우 ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16, ViT-L/14를 훈련합니다. 모든 모델을 32개의 에포크로 훈련합니다. 이득이나 편향이 아닌 모든 가중치에 디커플링 가중치 감쇠 정규화(Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017)를 적용한 Adam 최적화 도구(Kingma & Ba, 2014)를 사용하고 코사인 스케줄을 사용하여 학습 속도를 감쇠시킵니다(Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016). 초기 하이퍼파라미터는 그리드 검색, 무작위 검색, 수동 튜닝을 조합하여 기준 ResNet50 모델에 대해 1회에 걸쳐 훈련한 후 설정했습니다. 그런 다음 계산상의 제약으로 인해 더 큰 모델에 대해 하이퍼파라미터를 휴리스틱 방식으로 조정했습니다. 학습 가능한 온도 파라미터 τ는 (Wu et al., 2018)의 0.07에 해당하는 값으로 초기화되었고, 훈련 불안정성을 방지하기 위해 필요한 100 이상의 로짓 스케일링을 방지하기 위해 클리핑되었습니다. 32,768개의 매우 큰 미니배치 크기를 사용했습니다. 훈련 속도를 높이고 메모리를 절약하기 위해 혼합 정밀도(Micikevicius et al., 2017)를 사용했습니다. 5개의 ResNet과 3개의 비전 트랜스포머를 차례로 훈련합니다. 추가 메모리를 절약하기 위해 그라디언트 체크포인트(Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016), 반정밀 아담 통계(Dhariwal et al., 2020), 반정밀 확률적으로 둥근 텍스트 인코더 가중치를 사용했습니다. 임베딩 유사도 계산도 개별 GPU가 로컬 임베딩 배치에 필요한 쌍별 유사도의 하위 집합만 계산하는 방식으로 샤딩되었습니다. 가장 큰 ResNet 모델인 RN50x64는 592개의 V100 GPU에서 훈련하는 데 18일이 걸렸고, 가장 큰 Vision Transformer는 256개의 V100 GPU에서 12일이 걸렸습니다. 또한 ViT-L/14의 경우, FixRes와 유사한 성능을 향상시키기 위해 336픽셀의 더 높은 해상도로 한 번 더 사전 훈련했습니다(Touvron et al., 2019). 이 모델을 ViT-L/14@336px로 표시합니다. 달리 명시되지 않는 한, 이 백서에서 "CLIP"으로 보고된 모든 결과는 이 모델이 가장 성능이 좋은 것으로 확인된 것을 사용합니다.

## Experiments

### Zero-Shot Transfer

#### MOTIVATION

In computer vision, zero-shot learning usually refers to thestudy of generalizing to unseen object categories in imageclassification (Lampert et al., 2009). We instead use theterm in a broader sense and study generalization to unseendatasets. We motivate this as a proxy for performing unseen tasks, as aspired to in the zero-data learningpaper of Larochelle et al. (2008). While much research in the field ofunsupervised learning focuses on the representation learning capabilities of machine learning systems, wemotivate studying zero-shot transfer as a way of measuring the tasklearning capabilities of machine learning systems.In this view, a dataset evaluates performance on a task on a specific distribution. However, many popular computervision datasets were created by the research community primarilyas benchmarks to guide the development of generic imageclassification methods rather than measuring performanceon a specific task. While it is reasonable to say that theSVHN dataset measures the task of street number transcription on the distribution of Google Street Viewphotos, it is unclear what “real” task the CIFAR-10 dataset measures.It is clear, however, what distribution CIFAR-10 is drawnfrom - TinyImages (Torralba et al., 2008). On these kinds ofdatasets, zero-shot transfer is more an evaluation of CLIP’srobustness to distribution shift and domain generalizationrather than task generalization. Please see Section 3.3 foranalysis focused on this.

To our knowledge, Visual N-Grams (Li et al., 2017) first studied zero-shot transfer to existing image classification datasets in the manner described above. It is also the only other work we are aware of that has studied zero-shot transfer to standard image classification datasets using a generically pre-trained model and serves as the best reference point for contextualizing CLIP. Their approach learns the parameters of a dictionary of 142,806 visual n-grams (spanning 1- to 5- grams) and optimizes these n-grams using a differential version of Jelinek-Mercer smoothing to maximize the probability of all text n-grams for a given image. In order to perform zero-shot transfer, they first convert the text of each of the dataset’s class names into its n-gram representation and then compute its probability according to their model, predicting the one with the highest score.

Our focus on studying zero-shot transfer as an evaluation of task learning is inspired by work demonstrating task learning in the field of NLP. To our knowledge Liu et al. (2018) first identified task learning as an “unexpected side-effect” when a language model trained to generate Wikipedia articles learned to reliably transliterate names between languages. While GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018) focused on pretraining as a transfer learning method to improve supervised fine-tuning, it also included an ablation study demonstrating that the performance of four heuristic zero-shot transfer methods improved steadily over the course of pre-training, without any supervised adaption. This analysis served as the basis for GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) which focused exclusively on studying the task-learning capabilities of language models via zero-shot transfer.

컴퓨터 비전에서 제로 샷 학습은 일반적으로 이미지 분류에서 보이지 않는 객체 범주에 일반화하는 연구를 의미합니다(Lampert et al., 2009). 저희는 이 용어를 더 넓은 의미로 사용하며 보이지 않는 데이터 집합에 대한 일반화를 연구합니다. 이는 Larochelle 등(2008)의 제로 데이터 학습 논문에서 지향하는 것처럼, 보이지 않는 작업을 수행하기 위한 프록시로 동기를 부여합니다. 비지도 학습 분야의 많은 연구는 머신러닝 시스템의 표현 학습 능력에 초점을 맞추고 있지만, 우리는 머신러닝 시스템의 작업 학습 능력을 측정하는 방법으로 제로 샷 전이를 연구합니다. 이 관점에서 데이터 세트는 특정 분포에서 작업에 대한 성능을 평가합니다. 그러나 연구 커뮤니티에서 널리 사용되는 많은 컴퓨터 비전 데이터 세트는 주로 특정 작업에 대한 성능을 측정하기보다는 일반적인 이미지 분류 방법의 개발을 안내하기 위한 벤치마크로 만들어졌습니다. SVHN 데이터 세트가 Google 스트리트 뷰 사진의 분포에서 도로 번호 전사 작업을 측정한다고 말하는 것이 합리적이지만, CIFAR-10 데이터 세트가 어떤 "실제" 작업을 측정하는지는 불분명합니다. 그러나 CIFAR-10이 어떤 분포에서 가져온 것인지는 분명합니다 - TinyImages(Torralba et al., 2008). 이러한 종류의 데이터 세트에서 제로 샷 전송은 작업 일반화보다는 분포 이동 및 도메인 일반화에 대한 CLIP의 견고성을 평가하는 데 더 적합합니다. 이에 초점을 맞춘 분석은 섹션 3.3을 참조하세요.

우리가 아는 한, Visual N-Grams(Li et al., 2017)는 위에서 설명한 방식으로 기존 이미지 분류 데이터 세트에 대한 제로 샷 전이를 처음으로 연구했습니다. 이 연구는 일반적으로 사전 학습된 모델을 사용하여 표준 이미지 분류 데이터 세트에 대한 제로 샷 전이를 연구한 유일한 연구이며 CLIP의 컨텍스트화를 위한 가장 좋은 기준점이 됩니다. 이 접근 방식은 142,806개의 시각적 n-그램(1~5-그램에 걸쳐 있음)으로 구성된 사전의 파라미터를 학습하고 차등 버전의 Jelinek-Mercer 평활화를 사용하여 이러한 n-그램을 최적화하여 주어진 이미지에 대한 모든 텍스트 n-그램의 확률을 최대화합니다. 제로 샷 전송을 수행하기 위해 먼저 각 데이터 세트의 클래스 이름의 텍스트를 n-그램 표현으로 변환한 다음 모델에 따라 확률을 계산하여 가장 높은 점수를 얻은 클래스를 예측합니다.

작업 학습의 평가로서 제로 샷 전이를 연구하는 데 초점을 맞춘 것은 NLP 분야에서 작업 학습을 입증한 연구에서 영감을 얻었습니다. 우리가 아는 바로는 Liu 등(2018)은 위키백과 문서를 생성하도록 훈련된 언어 모델이 언어 간 이름을 안정적으로 음역하는 방법을 학습했을 때 '예상치 못한 부작용'으로 과제 학습을 처음 확인했습니다. GPT-1(Radford 외, 2018)은 감독 미세 조정을 개선하기 위한 전이 학습 방법으로서 사전 훈련에 중점을 두었지만, 여기에는 네 가지 휴리스틱 제로 샷 전이 방법의 성능이 감독 적응 없이 사전 훈련 과정에서 꾸준히 향상되었음을 보여주는 제거 연구도 포함되었습니다. 이 분석은 제로 샷 전이를 통한 언어 모델의 과제 학습 능력 연구에만 초점을 맞춘 GPT-2(Radford et al., 2019)의 기초가 되었습니다.

#### USING CLIP FOR ZERO-SHOT TRANSFER

CLIP is pre-trained to predict if an image and a text snippet are paired together in its dataset. To perform zero-shot classification, we reuse this capability. For each dataset, we use the names of all the classes in the dataset as the set of potential text pairings and predict the most probable (image, text) pair according to CLIP. In a bit more detail, we first compute the feature embedding of the image and the feature embedding of the set of possible texts by their respective encoders. The cosine similarity of these embeddings is then calculated, scaled by a temperature parameter τ , and normalized into a probability distribution via a softmax. Note that this prediction layer is a multinomial logistic regression classifier with L2-normalized inputs, L2-normalized weights, no bias, and temperature scaling. When interpreted this way, the image encoder is the computer vision backbone which computes a feature representation for the image and the text encoder is a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2016) which generates the weights of a linear classifier based on the text specifying the visual concepts that the classes represent. Lei Ba et al. (2015) first introduced a zero-shot image classifier of this form while the idea of generating a classifier from natural language dates back to at least Elhoseiny et al. (2013). Continuing with this interpretation, every step of CLIP pre-training can be viewed as optimizing the performance of a randomly created proxy to a computer vision dataset which contains 1 example per class and has 32,768 total classes defined via natural language descriptions. For zero-shot evaluation, we cache the zero-shot classifier once it has been computed by the text encoder and reuse it for all subsequent predictions. This allows the cost of generating it to be amortized across all the predictions in a dataset.

CLIP은 데이터 세트에서 이미지와 텍스트 스니펫이 함께 짝을 이루는지 예측하도록 사전 학습됩니다. 제로 샷 분류를 수행하기 위해 이 기능을 재사용합니다. 각 데이터 세트에 대해 데이터 세트의 모든 클래스 이름을 잠재적인 텍스트 쌍의 집합으로 사용하고 CLIP에 따라 가장 가능성이 높은 (이미지, 텍스트) 쌍을 예측합니다. 좀 더 자세히 설명하면, 먼저 이미지의 특징 임베딩과 각 인코더에 의한 가능한 텍스트 세트의 특징 임베딩을 계산합니다. 그런 다음 이러한 임베딩의 코사인 유사성을 계산하고 온도 매개변수 τ 로 스케일링한 다음 소프트맥스를 통해 확률 분포로 정규화합니다. 이 예측 레이어는 L2 정규화된 입력, L2 정규화된 가중치, 편향 없음, 온도 스케일링을 사용하는 다항 로지스틱 회귀 분류기라는 점에 유의하세요. 이렇게 해석하면 이미지 인코더는 이미지의 특징 표현을 계산하는 컴퓨터 비전 백본이고 텍스트 인코더는 클래스가 나타내는 시각적 개념을 지정하는 텍스트를 기반으로 선형 분류기의 가중치를 생성하는 하이퍼네트워크(Ha et al., 2016)입니다. Lei Ba 등(2015)이 이러한 형태의 제로 샷 이미지 분류기를 처음 도입했지만, 자연어에서 분류기를 생성하는 아이디어는 적어도 Elhoseiny 등(2013)으로 거슬러 올라갑니다. 이러한 해석을 계속 이어가면, CLIP 사전 학습의 모든 단계는 클래스당 1개의 예제를 포함하고 자연어 설명을 통해 정의된 총 32,768개의 클래스가 있는 컴퓨터 비전 데이터 세트에 무작위로 생성된 프록시의 성능을 최적화하는 것으로 볼 수 있습니다. 제로 샷 평가의 경우, 텍스트 인코더에서 제로 샷 분류기를 계산한 후 이를 캐시하여 이후의 모든 예측에 재사용합니다. 이를 통해 데이터 세트의 모든 예측에 걸쳐 이를 생성하는 비용을 상각할 수 있습니다.

#### INITIAL COMPARISON TO VISUAL N-GRAMS

In Table 1 we compare Visual N-Grams to CLIP. The best CLIP model improves accuracy on ImageNet from a proof of concept 11.5% to 76.2% and matches the performance of the original ResNet-50 despite using none of the 1.28 million crowd-labeled training examples available for this dataset. Additionally, the top-5 accuracy of CLIP models are noticeably higher than their top-1, and this model has a 95% top-5 accuracy, matching Inception-V4 (Szegedy et al., 2016). The ability to match the performance of a strong, fully supervised baselines in a zero-shot setting suggests CLIP is a significant step towards flexible and practical zero-shot computer vision classifiers. As mentioned above, the comparison to Visual N-Grams is meant for contextualizing the performance of CLIP and should not be interpreted as a direct methods comparison between CLIP and Visual N-Grams as many performance relevant differences between the two systems were not controlled for. For instance, we train on a dataset that is 10x larger, use a vision model that requires nearly 100x more compute per prediction, likely used over 1000x their training compute, and use a transformer-based model which did not exist when Visual N-Grams was published. As a closer comparison, we trained a CLIP ResNet-50 on the same YFCC100M dataset that Visual N-Grams was trained on and found it matched their reported ImageNet performance within a V100 GPU day. This baseline was also trained from scratch instead of being initialized from pre-trained ImageNet weights as in Visual N-Grams.

CLIP also outperforms Visual N-Grams on the other 2 reported datasets. On aYahoo, CLIP achieves a 95% reduction in the number of errors, and on SUN, CLIP more than doubles the accuracy of Visual N-Grams. To conduct a more comprehensive analysis and stress test, we implement a much larger evaluation suite detailed in Appendix A. In total we expand from the 3 datasets reported in Visual NGrams to include over 30 datasets and compare to over 50 existing computer vision systems to contextualize results.

표 1에서는 Visual N-Gram과 CLIP을 비교합니다. 최고의 CLIP 모델은 이 데이터 세트에 사용할 수 있는 128만 개의 크라우드 라벨링 학습 예제 중 어느 것도 사용하지 않았음에도 불구하고 개념 증명 수준에서 이미지넷의 정확도를 11.5%에서 76.2%로 향상시켰으며 원래 ResNet-50의 성능과 일치합니다. 또한 CLIP 모델의 상위 5위 정확도는 상위 1위보다 눈에 띄게 높으며, 이 모델의 상위 5위 정확도는 95%에 달해 Inception-V4와 일치합니다(Szegedy et al., 2016). 제로 샷 설정에서 강력하고 완전히 감독된 기준선의 성능과 일치할 수 있다는 것은 CLIP이 유연하고 실용적인 제로 샷 컴퓨터 비전 분류기를 향한 중요한 단계임을 시사합니다. 위에서 언급했듯이 Visual N-Gram과의 비교는 CLIP의 성능을 맥락화하기 위한 것으로, 두 시스템 간의 많은 성능 관련 차이가 통제되지 않았으므로 CLIP과 Visual N-Gram 간의 직접적인 방법 비교로 해석해서는 안 됩니다. 예를 들어, 10배 더 큰 데이터 세트에서 학습하고, 예측당 거의 100배 더 많은 컴퓨팅을 필요로 하는 비전 모델을 사용하며, 학습 컴퓨팅을 1000배 이상 사용했을 가능성이 있는 트랜스포머 기반 모델을 사용하고, Visual N-Grams가 출시될 당시에는 존재하지 않았던 트랜스포머 기반 모델을 사용했습니다. 더 자세히 비교하기 위해 Visual N-Grams가 훈련된 것과 동일한 YFCC100M 데이터 세트에서 CLIP ResNet-50을 훈련한 결과, V100 GPU 하루 만에 보고된 ImageNet 성능과 일치하는 것으로 나타났습니다. 이 기준선 역시 Visual N-Grams에서처럼 사전 훈련된 이미지넷 가중치에서 초기화하지 않고 처음부터 훈련했습니다.

CLIP은 보고된 다른 2개의 데이터 세트에서도 Visual N-Gram을 능가하는 성능을 보였습니다. aYahoo에서 CLIP은 오류 수를 95% 감소시켰으며, SUN에서는 Visual N-Gram의 정확도를 두 배 이상 높였습니다. 보다 포괄적인 분석과 스트레스 테스트를 수행하기 위해 부록 A에 자세히 설명된 훨씬 더 큰 규모의 평가 세트를 구현했습니다. 총 3개의 데이터 세트에서 30개 이상의 데이터 세트를 포함하도록 확장하고 50개 이상의 기존 컴퓨터 비전 시스템과 비교하여 결과를 맥락화합니다.

#### PROMPT ENGINEERING AND ENSEMBLING

Most standard image classification datasets treat the information naming or describing classes which enables natural language based zero-shot transfer as an afterthought. The vast majority of datasets annotate images with just a numeric id of the label and contain a file mapping these ids back to their names in English. Some datasets, such as Flowers102 and GTSRB, don’t appear to include this mapping at all in their released versions preventing zero-shot transfer entirely.2 For many datasets, we observed these labels may be chosen somewhat haphazardly and do not anticipate issues related to zero-shot transfer which relies on task description in order to transfer successfully.

A common issue is polysemy. When the name of a class is the only information provided to CLIP’s text encoder it is unable to differentiate which word sense is meant due to the lack of context. In some cases multiple meanings of the same word might be included as different classes in the same dataset! This happens in ImageNet which contains both construction cranes and cranes that fly. Another example is found in classes of the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset where the word boxer is, from context, clearly referring to a breed of dog, but to a text encoder lacking context could just as likely refer to a type of athlete.

Another issue we encountered is that it’s relatively rare in our pre-training dataset for the text paired with the image to be just a single word. Usually the text is a full sentence describing the image in some way. To help bridge this distribution gap, we found that using the prompt template “A photo of a {label}.” to be a good default that helps specify the text is about the content of the image. This often improves performance over the baseline of using only the label text. For instance, just using this prompt improves accuracy on ImageNet by 1.3%. Similar to the “prompt engineering” discussion around GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020), we have also observed that zero-shot performance can be significantly improved by customizing the prompt text to each task. A few, non exhaustive, examples follow. We found on several fine-grained image classification datasets that it helped to specify the category. For example on Oxford-IIIT Pets, using “A photo of a {label}, a type of pet.” to help provide context worked well. Likewise, on Food101 specifying a type of food and on FGVC Aircraft a type of aircraft helped too. For OCR datasets, we found that putting quotes around the text or number to be recognized improved performance. Finally, we found that on satellite image classification datasets it helped to specify that the images were of this form and we use variants of “a satellite photo of a {label}.”.

We also experimented with ensembling over multiple zeroshot classifiers as another way of improving performance. These classifiers are computed by using different context prompts such as ‘A photo of a big {label}” and “A photo of a small {label}”. We construct the ensemble over the embedding space instead of probability space. This allows us to cache a single set of averaged text embeddings so that the compute cost of the ensemble is the same as using a single classifier when amortized over many predictions. We’ve observed ensembling across many generated zero-shot classifiers to reliably improve performance and use it for the majority of datasets. On ImageNet, we ensemble 80 different context prompts and this improves performance by an additional 3.5% over the single default prompt discussed above. When considered together, prompt engineering and ensembling improve ImageNet accuracy by almost 5%. In Figure 4 we visualize how prompt engineering and ensembling change the performance of a set of CLIP models compared to the contextless baseline approach of directly embedding the class name as done in Li et al. (2017).

대부분의 표준 이미지 분류 데이터 세트는 자연어 기반 제로 샷 전송을 가능하게 하는 클래스 이름 지정 또는 설명 정보를 사후 처리합니다. 대부분의 데이터 세트는 라벨의 숫자 ID로만 이미지에 주석을 달고 이 ID를 다시 영어로 된 이름에 매핑하는 파일을 포함합니다. Flowers102 및 GTSRB와 같은 일부 데이터 세트는 릴리즈된 버전에 이 매핑이 전혀 포함되어 있지 않아 제로 샷 전송을 완전히 방지하는 것으로 보입니다.2 많은 데이터 세트에서 이러한 라벨이 다소 우연적으로 선택되어 성공적인 전송을 위해 작업 설명에 의존하는 제로 샷 전송과 관련된 문제를 예상하지 못하는 것으로 나타났습니다.

일반적인 문제는 다의어입니다. 클래스 이름만이 CLIP의 텍스트 인코더에 제공되는 유일한 정보인 경우, 문맥이 부족하기 때문에 어떤 단어의 의미를 의미하는지 구분할 수 없습니다. 경우에 따라 같은 단어의 여러 의미가 동일한 데이터 세트에 다른 클래스로 포함될 수 있습니다! 건설 크레인과 날아다니는 크레인이 모두 포함된 ImageNet에서 이런 일이 발생합니다. 또 다른 예는 Oxford-IIIT 애완동물 데이터 세트의 클래스에서 찾을 수 있는데, 문맥상 복서라는 단어는 분명히 개 품종을 가리키지만 문맥이 부족한 텍스트 인코더에게는 운동선수의 한 종류를 가리킬 가능성이 높습니다.

또 다른 문제는 사전 학습 데이터 세트에서 이미지와 짝을 이루는 텍스트가 단 한 단어인 경우가 비교적 드물다는 점입니다. 일반적으로 텍스트는 어떤 식으로든 이미지를 설명하는 전체 문장으로 구성됩니다. 이러한 분포 격차를 해소하기 위해 '{라벨}의 사진'이라는 프롬프트 템플릿을 사용하면 이미지의 내용에 대한 텍스트를 지정하는 데 도움이 되는 좋은 기본값이 된다는 사실을 발견했습니다. 이렇게 하면 라벨 텍스트만 사용하는 기본값보다 성능이 향상되는 경우가 많습니다. 예를 들어, 이 프롬프트를 사용하는 것만으로도 ImageNet의 정확도가 1.3% 향상됩니다. GPT3에 대한 "프롬프트 엔지니어링" 논의와 유사하게, 각 작업에 맞게 프롬프트 텍스트를 사용자 지정함으로써 제로 샷 성능을 크게 향상시킬 수 있다는 사실도 관찰되었습니다(Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020). 다음은 몇 가지 예시입니다. 여러 세분화된 이미지 분류 데이터 세트에서 카테고리를 지정하는 것이 도움이 된다는 것을 발견했습니다. 예를 들어 Oxford-IIIT Pets에서는 "{레이블}의 사진, 애완동물의 한 종류."를 사용하여 컨텍스트를 제공하는 것이 효과적이었습니다. 마찬가지로 Food101에서는 음식의 종류를, FGVC Aircraft에서는 항공기의 종류를 지정하는 것도 도움이 되었습니다. OCR 데이터 세트의 경우, 인식할 텍스트나 숫자 주위에 따옴표를 넣으면 성능이 향상되는 것을 발견했습니다. 마지막으로 위성 이미지 분류 데이터세트에서는 이미지가 이러한 형식임을 명시하고 "{라벨}의 위성 사진"과 같은 변형을 사용하는 것이 도움이 된다는 것을 발견했습니다.

또한 성능 향상을 위한 또 다른 방법으로 여러 개의 제로샷 분류기를 조합하는 실험도 진행했습니다. 이러한 분류기는 '큰 {라벨}의 사진'과 '작은 {라벨}의 사진'과 같은 서로 다른 문맥 프롬프트를 사용하여 계산됩니다. 확률 공간 대신 임베딩 공간에 앙상블을 구성합니다. 이렇게 하면 평균화된 텍스트 임베딩의 단일 세트를 캐시할 수 있으므로 여러 예측에 걸쳐 상각할 때 앙상블의 계산 비용이 단일 분류기를 사용하는 것과 동일해집니다. 생성된 수많은 제로 샷 분류기에 걸쳐 앙상블을 적용하여 성능을 안정적으로 개선하고 대부분의 데이터 세트에 사용하는 것을 관찰했습니다. 이미지넷에서는 80개의 서로 다른 컨텍스트 프롬프트를 앙상블하여 위에서 설명한 단일 기본 프롬프트보다 성능을 3.5% 추가로 향상시켰습니다. 프롬프트 엔지니어링과 앙상블을 함께 고려하면 ImageNet의 정확도가 거의 5% 향상됩니다. 그림 4에서는 프롬프트 엔지니어링과 앙상블이 Li 등(2017)에서처럼 클래스 이름을 직접 임베딩하는 컨텍스트 없는 기준 접근 방식과 비교하여 CLIP 모델 세트의 성능을 어떻게 변화시키는지 시각화합니다.

#### ANALYSIS OF ZERO-SHOT CLIP PERFORMANCE

Since task-agnostic zero-shot classifiers for computer vision have been understudied, CLIP provides a promising opportunity to gain a better understanding of this type of model. In this section, we conduct a study of various properties of CLIP’s zero-shot classifiers. As a first question, we look simply at how well zero-shot classifiers perform. To contextualize this, we compare to the performance of a simple off-the-shelf baseline: fitting a fully supervised, regularized, logistic regression classifier on the features of the canonical ResNet-50. In Figure 5 we show this comparison across 27 datasets. Please see Appendix A for details of datasets and setup.

Zero-shot CLIP outperforms this baseline slightly more of ten than not and wins on 16 of the 27 datasets. Looking at individual datasets reveals some interesting behavior. On fine-grained classification tasks, we observe a wide spread in performance. On two of these datasets, Stanford Cars and Food101, zero-shot CLIP outperforms logistic regression on ResNet-50 features by over 20% while on two others, Flowers102 and FGVCAircraft, zero-shot CLIP underperforms by over 10%. On OxfordPets and Birdsnap, performance is much closer. We suspect these difference are primarily due to varying amounts of per-task supervision between WIT and ImageNet. On “general” object classification datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10/100, STL10, and PascalVOC2007 performance is relatively similar with a slight advantage for zero-shot CLIP in all cases. On STL10, CLIP achieves 99.3% overall which appears to be a new state of the art despite not using any training examples. Zeroshot CLIP significantly outperforms a ResNet-50 on two datasets measuring action recognition in videos. On Kinetics700, CLIP outperforms a ResNet-50 by 14.5%. Zeroshot CLIP also outperforms a ResNet-50’s features by 7.7% on UCF101. We speculate this is due to natural language providing wider supervision for visual concepts involving verbs, compared to the noun-centric object supervision in ImageNet.

Looking at where zero-shot CLIP notably underperforms, we see that zero-shot CLIP is quite weak on several specialized, complex, or abstract tasks such as satellite image classification (EuroSAT and RESISC45), lymph node tumor detection (PatchCamelyon), counting objects in synthetic scenes (CLEVRCounts), self-driving related tasks such as German traffic sign recognition (GTSRB), recognizing distance to the nearest car (KITTI Distance). These results highlight the poor capability of zero-shot CLIP on more complex tasks. By contrast, non-expert humans can robustly perform several of these tasks, such as counting, satellite image classification, and traffic sign recognition, suggesting significant room for improvement. However, we caution that it is unclear whether measuring zero-shot transfer, as opposed to few-shot transfer, is a meaningful evaluation for difficult tasks that a learner has no prior experience with, such as lymph node tumor classification for almost all humans (and possibly CLIP).

While comparing zero-shot performance to fully supervised models contextualizes the task-learning capabilities of CLIP, comparing to few-shot methods is a more direct comparison, since zero-shot is its limit. In Figure 6, we visualize how zero-shot CLIP compares to few-shot logistic regression on the features of many image models including the best publicly available ImageNet models, self-supervised learning methods, and CLIP itself. While it is intuitive to expect zero-shot to underperform one-shot, we instead find that zero-shot CLIP matches the performance of 4-shot logistic regression on the same feature space. This is likely due to an important difference between the zero-shot and few-shot approach. First, CLIP’s zero-shot classifier is generated via natural language which allows for visual concepts to be directly specified (“communicated”). By contrast, “normal” supervised learning must infer concepts indirectly from training examples. Context-less example-based learning has the drawback that many different hypotheses can be consistent with the data, especially in the one-shot case. A single image often contains many different visual concepts. Although a capable learner is able to exploit visual cues and heuristics, such as assuming that the concept being demonstrated is the primary object in an image, there is no guarantee.

A potential resolution of this discrepancy between zeroshot and few-shot performance is to use CLIP’s zero-shot classifier as a prior for the weights of the few-shot classifier. While adding an L2 penalty towards the generated weights is a straightforward implementation of this idea, we found that hyperparameter optimization would often select for such a large value of this regularizer that the resulting fewshot classifier was “just” the zero-shot classifier. Research into better methods of combining the strength of zero-shot transfer with flexibility of few-shot learning is a promising direction for future work.

When comparing zero-shot CLIP to few-shot logistic regression on the features of other models, zero-shot CLIP roughly matches the performance of the best performing 16-shot classifier in our evaluation suite, which uses the features of a BiT-M ResNet-152x2 trained on ImageNet-21K. We are certain that a BiT-L model trained on JFT-300M would perform even better but these models have not been publicly released. That a BiT-M ResNet-152x2 performs best in a 16-shot setting is somewhat surprising since, as analyzed in Section 3.2, the Noisy Student EfficientNet-L2 outperforms it in a fully supervised setting by almost 5% on average across 27 datasets.

In addition to studying the average performance of zero-shot CLIP and few-shot logistic regression, we also examine performance on individual datasets. In Figure 7, we show estimates for the number of labeled examples per class that a logistic regression classifier on the same feature space requires to match the performance of zero-shot CLIP. Since zero-shot CLIP is also a linear classifier, this estimates the effective data efficiency of zero-shot transfer in this setting. In order to avoid training thousands of linear classifiers, we estimate the effective data efficiency based on a loglinear interpolation of the performance of a 1, 2, 4, 8, 16- shot (when possible), and a fully supervised linear classifier trained on each dataset. We find that zero-shot transfer can have widely varying efficiency per dataset from less than 1 labeled example per class to 184. Two datasets, Flowers102 and EuroSAT underperform one-shot models. Half of the datasets require less than 5 examples per class with a median of 5.4. However, the mean estimated data efficiency is 20.8 examples per class. This is due to the 20% of datasets where supervised classifiers require many labeled examples per class in order to match performance. On ImageNet, zero-shot CLIP matches the performance of a 16-shot linear classifier trained on the same feature space.

If we assume that evaluation datasets are large enough that the parameters of linear classifiers trained on them are well estimated, then, because CLIP’s zero-shot classifier is also a linear classifier, the performance of the fully supervised classifiers roughly sets an upper bound for what zero-shot transfer can achieve. In Figure 8 we compare CLIP’s zeroshot performance with fully supervised linear classifiers across datasets. The dashed, y = x line represents an “optimal” zero-shot classifier that matches the performance of its fully supervised equivalent. For most datasets, the performance of zero-shot classifiers still underperform fully supervised classifiers by 10% to 25%, suggesting that there is still plenty of headroom for improving CLIP’s task-learning and zero-shot transfer capabilities.

There is a positive correlation of 0.82 (p-value < 10−6) between zero-shot performance and fully supervised performance, suggesting that CLIP is relatively consistent at connecting underlying representation and task learning to zeroshot transfer. However, zero-shot CLIP only approaches fully supervised performance on 5 datasets: STL10, CIFAR10, Food101, OxfordPets, and Caltech101. On all 5 datasets, both zero-shot accuracy and fully supervised accuracy are over 90%. This suggests that CLIP may be more effective at zero-shot transfer for tasks where its underlying representations are also high quality. The slope of a linear regression model predicting zero-shot performance as a function of fully supervised performance estimates that for every 1% improvement in fully supervised performance, zero-shot performance improves by 1.28%. However, the 95th-percentile confidence intervals still include values of less than 1 (0.93-1.79).

Over the past few years, empirical studies of deep learning systems have documented that performance is predictable as a function of important quantities such as training compute and dataset size (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020). The GPT family of models has so far demonstrated consistent improvements in zero-shot performance across a 1000x increase in training compute. In Figure 9, we check whether the zero-shot performance of CLIP follows a similar scaling pattern. We plot the average error rate of the 5 ResNet CLIP models across 39 evaluations on 36 different datasets and find that a similar log-log linear scaling trend holds for CLIP across a 44x increase in model compute. While the overall trend is smooth, we found that performance on individual evaluations can be much noisier. We are unsure whether this is caused by high variance between individual training runs on sub-tasks (as documented in D’Amour et al. (2020)) masking a steadily improving trend or whether performance is actually non-monotonic as a function of compute on some tasks.

### Representation Learning

While we have extensively analyzed the task-learning capabilities of CLIP through zero-shot transfer in the previous section, it is more common to study the representation learning capabilities of a model. There exist many ways to evaluate the quality of representations as well as disagreements over what properties an “ideal” representation should have (Locatello et al., 2020). Fitting a linear classifier on a representation extracted from the model and measuring its performance on various datasets is a common approach. An alternative is measuring the performance of end-to-end fine-tuning of the model. This increases flexibility, and prior work has convincingly demonstrated that fine-tuning outperforms linear classification on most image classification datasets (Kornblith et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2019). While the high performance of fine-tuning motivates its study for practical reasons, we still opt for linear classifier based evaluation for several reasons. Our work is focused on developing a high-performing task and dataset-agnostic pre-training approach. Fine-tuning, because it adapts representations to each dataset during the fine-tuning phase, can compensate for and potentially mask failures to learn general and robust representations during the pre-training phase. Linear classifiers, because of their limited flexibility, instead highlight these failures and provide clear feedback during development. For CLIP, training supervised linear classifiers has the added benefit of being very similar to the approach used for its zero-shot classifiers which enables extensive comparisons and analysis in Section 3.1. Finally, we aim to compare CLIP to a comprehensive set of existing models across many tasks. Studying 66 different models on 27 different datasets requires tuning 1782 different evaluations. Fine-tuning opens up a much larger design and hyperparameter space, which makes it difficult to fairly evaluate and computationally expensive to compare a diverse set of techniques as discussed in other large scale empirical studies (Lucic et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019). By comparison, linear classifiers require minimal hyper-parameter tuning and have standardized implementations and evaluation procedures. Please see Appendix A for further details on evaluation.

Figure 10 summarizes our findings. To minimize selection effects that could raise concerns of confirmation or reporting bias, we first study performance on the 12 dataset evaluation suite from Kornblith et al. (2019). While small CLIP models such as a ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 outperform other ResNets trained on ImageNet-1K (BiT-S and the originals), they underperform ResNets trained on ImageNet-21K (BiTM). These small CLIP models also underperform models in the EfficientNet family with similar compute requirements. However, models trained with CLIP scale very well and the largest model we trained (ResNet-50x64) slightly outperforms the best performing existing model (a Noisy Student EfficientNet-L2) on both overall score and compute efficiency. We also find that CLIP vision transformers are about 3x more compute efficient than CLIP ResNets, which allows us to reach higher overall performance within our compute budget. These results qualitatively replicate the findings of Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) which reported that vision transformers are more compute efficient than convnets when trained on sufficiently large datasets. Our best overall model is a ViT-L/14 that is fine-tuned at a higher resolution of 336 pixels on our dataset for 1 additional epoch. This model outperforms the best existing model across this evaluation suite by an average of 2.6%.

As Figure 21 qualitatively shows, CLIP models learn a wider set of tasks than has previously been demonstrated in a single computer vision model trained end-to-end from random initialization. These tasks include geo-localization, optical character recognition, facial emotion recognition, and action recognition. None of these tasks are measured in the evaluation suite of Kornblith et al. (2019). This could be argued to be a form of selection bias in Kornblith et al. (2019)’s study towards tasks that overlap with ImageNet. To address this, we also measure performance on a broader 27 dataset evaluation suite. This evaluation suite, detailed in Appendix A includes datasets representing the aforementioned tasks, German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark (Stallkamp et al., 2011), as well as several other datasets adapted from VTAB (Zhai et al., 2019). On this broader evaluation suite, the benefits of CLIP are more clear. All CLIP models, regardless of scale, outperform all evaluated systems in terms of compute efficiency. The improvement in average score of the best model over previous systems increases from 2.6% to 5%. We also find that self-supervised systems do noticeably better on our broader evaluation suite. For instance, while SimCLRv2 still underperforms BiT-M on average on the 12 datasets of Kornblith et al. (2019), SimCLRv2 outperforms BiT-M on our 27 dataset evaluation suite. These findings suggest continuing to expand task diversity and coverage in order to better understand the “general” performance of systems. We suspect additional evaluation efforts along the lines of VTAB to be valuable.

In addition to the aggregate analysis above, we visualize per-dataset differences in the performance of the best CLIP model and the best model in our evaluation suite across all 27 datasets in Figure 11. CLIP outperforms the Noisy Student EfficientNet-L2 on 21 of the 27 datasets. CLIP improves the most on tasks which require OCR (SST2 and HatefulMemes), geo-localization and scene recognition (Country211, SUN397), and activity recognition in videos (Kinetics700 and UCF101). In addition CLIP also does much better on fine-grained car and traffic sign recognition (Stanford Cars and GTSRB). This may reflect a problem with overly narrow supervision in ImageNet. A result such as the 14.7% improvement on GTSRB could be indicative of an issue with ImageNet-1K, which has only a single label for all traffic and street signs. This could encourage a supervised representation to collapse intra-class details and hurt accuracy on a fine-grained downstream task. As mentioned, CLIP still underperforms the EfficientNet on several datasets. Unsurprisingly, the dataset that the EfficientNet does best relative to CLIP on is the one it was trained on: ImageNet. The EffcientNet also slightly outperforms CLIP on low-resolution datasets such as CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. We suspect this is at least partly due to the lack of scale-based data augmentation in CLIP. The EfficientNet also does slightly better on PatchCamelyon and CLEVRCounts, datasets where overall performance is still low for both approaches.

### Robustness to Natural Distribution Shift

In 2015, it was announced that a deep learning model exceeded human performance on the ImageNet test set (He et al., 2015). However, research in the subsequent years has repeatedly found that these models still make many simple mistakes (Dodge & Karam, 2017; Geirhos et al., 2018; Alcorn et al., 2019), and new benchmarks testing these systems has often found their performance to be much lower than both their ImageNet accuracy and human accuracy (Recht et al., 2019; Barbu et al., 2019). What explains this discrepancy? Various ideas have been suggested and studied (Ilyas et al., 2019; Geirhos et al., 2020). A common theme of proposed explanations is that deep learning models are exceedingly adept at finding correlations and patterns which hold across their training dataset and thus improve in-distribution performance. However many of these correlations and patterns are actually spurious and do not hold for other distributions and result in large drops in performance on other datasets.

We caution that, to date, most of these studies limit their evaluation to models trained on ImageNet. Recalling the topic of discussion, it may be a mistake to generalize too far from these initial findings. To what degree are these failures attributable to deep learning, ImageNet, or some combination of the two? CLIP models, which are trained via natural language supervision on a very large dataset and are capable of high zero-shot performance, are an opportunity to investigate this question from a different angle.

Taori et al. (2020) is a recent comprehensive study moving towards quantifying and understanding these behaviors for ImageNet models. Taori et al. (2020) study how the performance of ImageNet models change when evaluated on natural distribution shifts. They measure performance on a set of 7 distribution shifts: ImageNetV2 (Recht et al., 2019), ImageNet Sketch (Wang et al., 2019), Youtube-BB and ImageNet-Vid (Shankar et al., 2019), ObjectNet (Barbu et al., 2019), ImageNet Adversarial (Hendrycks et al., 2019), and ImageNet Rendition (Hendrycks et al., 2020a). They distinguish these datasets, which all consist of novel images collected from a variety of sources, from synthetic distribution shifts such as ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019), Stylized ImageNet (Geirhos et al., 2018), or adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) which are created by perturbing existing images in various ways. They propose this distinction because in part because they find that while several techniques have been demonstrated to improve performance on synthetic distribution shifts, they often fail to yield consistent improvements on natural distributions.

Across these collected datasets, the accuracy of ImageNet models drop well below the expectation set by the ImageNet validation set. For the following summary discussion we report average accuracy across all 7 natural distribution shift datasets and average accuracy across the corresponding class subsets of ImageNet unless otherwise specified. Additionally, for Youtube-BB and ImageNet-Vid, which have two different evaluation settings, we use the average of pm-0 and pm-10 accuracy

A ResNet-101 makes 5 times as many mistakes when evaluated on these natural distribution shifts compared to the ImageNet validation set. Encouragingly however, Taori et al. (2020) find that accuracy under distribution shift increases predictably with ImageNet accuracy and is well modeled as a linear function of logit-transformed accuracy. Taori et al. (2020) use this finding to propose that robustness analysis should distinguish between effective and relative robustness. Effective robustness measures improvements in accuracy under distribution shift above what is predicted by the documented relationship between in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy. Relative robustness captures any improvement in out-of-distribution accuracy. Taori et al. (2020) argue that robustness techniques should aim to improve both effective robustness and relative robustness.

Almost all models studied in Taori et al. (2020) are trained or fine-tuned on the ImageNet dataset. Returning to the discussion in the introduction to this section - is training or adapting to the ImageNet dataset distribution the cause of the observed robustness gap? Intuitively, a zero-shot model should not be able to exploit spurious correlations or patterns that hold only on a specific distribution, since it is not trained on that distribution. 4 Thus it is reasonable to expect zero-shot models to have much higher effective robustness. In Figure 13, we compare the performance of zero-shot CLIP with existing ImageNet models on natural distribution shifts. All zero-shot CLIP models improve effective robustness by a large amount and reduce the size of the gap between ImageNet accuracy and accuracy under distribution shift by up to 75%.

While these results show that zero-shot models can be much more robust, they do not necessarily mean that supervised learning on ImageNet causes a robustness gap. Other details of CLIP, such as its large and diverse pre-training dataset or use of natural language supervision could also result in much more robust models regardless of whether they are zero-shot or fine-tuned. As an initial experiment to potentially begin narrowing this down, we also measure how the performance of CLIP models change after adapting to the ImageNet distribution via a L2 regularized logistic regression classifier fit to CLIP features on the ImageNet training set. We visualize how performance changes from the zero-shot classifier in Figure 14. Although adapting CLIP to the ImageNet distribution increases its ImageNet accuracy by 9.2% to 85.4% overall, and ties the accuracy of the 2018 SOTA from Mahajan et al. (2018), average accuracy under distribution shift slightly decreases.

It is surprising to see a 9.2% increase in accuracy, which corresponds to roughly 3 years of improvement in SOTA, fail to translate into any improvement in average performance under distribution shift. We also break down the differences between zero-shot accuracy and linear classifier accuracy per dataset in Figure 14 and find performance still increases significantly on one dataset, ImageNetV2. ImageNetV2 closely followed the creation process of the original ImageNet dataset which suggests that gains in accuracy from supervised adaptation are closely concentrated around the ImageNet distribution. Performance decreases by 4.7% on ImageNet-R, 3.8% on ObjectNet, 2.8% on ImageNet Sketch, and 1.9% on ImageNet-A. The change in accuracy on the two other datasets, Youtube-BB and ImageNet Vid, is insignificant.

How is it possible to improve accuracy by 9.2% on the ImageNet dataset with little to no increase in accuracy under distribution shift? Is the gain primarily from “exploiting spurious correlations”? Is this behavior unique to some combination of CLIP, the ImageNet datatset, and the distribution shifts studied, or a more general phenomena? Does it hold for end-to-end finetuning as well as linear classifiers? We do not have confident answers to these questions at this time. Prior work has also pre-trained models on distributions other than ImageNet, but it is common to study and release models only after they have been fine-tuned to ImageNet. As a step towards understanding whether pre-trained zero-shot models consistently have higher effective robustness than fine-tuned models, we encourage the authors of Mahajan et al. (2018), Kolesnikov et al. (2019), and Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) to, if possible, study these questions on their models as well.

We also investigate another robustness intervention enabled by flexible zero-shot natural-language-based image classifiers. The target classes across the 7 transfer datasets are not always perfectly aligned with those of ImageNet. Two datasets, Youtube-BB and ImageNet-Vid, consist of superclasses of ImageNet. This presents a problem when trying to use the fixed 1000-way classifier of an ImageNet model to make predictions. Taori et al. (2020) handle this by max pooling predictions across all sub-classes according to the ImageNet class hierarchy. Sometimes this mapping is much less than perfect. For the person class in Youtube-BB, predictions are made by pooling over the ImageNet classes for a baseball player, a bridegroom, and a scuba diver. With CLIP we can instead generate a custom zero-shot classifier for each dataset directly based on its class names. In Figure 14 we see that this improves average effective robustness by 5% but is concentrated in large improvements on only a few datasets. Curiously, accuracy on ObjectNet also increases by 2.3%. Although the dataset was designed to closely overlap with ImageNet classes, using the names provided for each class by ObjectNet’s creators still helps a small amount compared to using ImageNet class names and pooling predictions when necessary

While zero-shot CLIP improves effective robustness, Figure 14 shows that the benefit is almost entirely gone in a fully supervised setting. To better understand this difference, we investigate how effective robustness changes on the continuum from zero-shot to fully supervised. In Figure 15 we visualize the performance of 0-shot, 1-shot, 2-shot, 4-shot ..., 128-shot, and fully supervised logistic regression classifiers on the best CLIP model’s features. We see that while few-shot models also show higher effective robustness than existing models, this benefit fades as in-distribution performance increases with more training data and is mostly, though not entirely, gone for the fully supervised model. Additionally, zero-shot CLIP is notably more robust than a few-shot model with equivalent ImageNet performance. Across our experiments, high effective robustness seems to result from minimizing the amount of distribution specific training data a model has access to, but this comes at a cost of reducing dataset-specific performance.

Taken together, these results suggest that the recent shift towards large-scale task and dataset agnostic pre-training combined with a reorientation towards zero-shot and fewshot benchmarking on broad evaluation suites (as advocated by Yogatama et al. (2019) and Linzen (2020)) promotes the development of more robust systems and provides a more accurate assessment of performance. We are curious to see if the same results hold for zero-shot models in the field of NLP such as the GPT family. While Hendrycks et al. (2020b) has reported that pre-training improves relative robustness on sentiment analysis, Miller et al. (2020)’s study of the robustness of question answering models under natural distribution shift finds, similar to Taori et al. (2020), little evidence of effective robustness improvements to date

## Comparison to Human Performance

How does CLIP compare to human performance and human learning? To get a better understanding of how well humans perform in similar evaluation settings to CLIP, we evaluated humans on one of our tasks. We wanted to get a sense of how strong human zero-shot performance is at these tasks, and how much human performance is improved if they are shown one or two image samples. This can help us to compare task difficulty for humans and CLIP, and identify correlations and differences between them.

We had five different humans look at each of 3669 images in the test split of the Oxford IIT Pets dataset (Parkhi et al., 2012) and select which of the 37 cat or dog breeds best matched the image (or ‘I don’t know’ if they were completely uncertain). In the zero-shot case the humans were given no examples of the breeds and asked to label them to the best of their ability without an internet search. In the one-shot experiment the humans were given one sample image of each breed and in the two-shot experiment they were given two sample images of each breed.5

One possible concern was that the human workers were not sufficiently motivated in the zero-shot task. High human accuracy of 94% on the STL-10 dataset (Coates et al., 2011) and 97-100% accuracy on the subset of attention check images increased our trust in the human workers.

Interestingly, humans went from a performance average of 54% to 76% with just one training example per class, and the marginal gain from an additional training example is minimal. The gain in accuracy going from zero to one shot is almost entirely on images that humans were uncertain about. This suggests that humans “know what they don’t know” and are able to update their priors on the images they are most uncertain in based on a single example. Given this, it seems that while CLIP is a promising training strategy for zero-shot performance (Figure 5) and does well on tests of natural distribution shift (Figure 13), there is a large difference between how humans learn from a few examples and the few-shot methods in this paper.

This suggests that there are still algorithmic improvements waiting to be made to decrease the gap between machine and human sample efficiency, as noted by Lake et al. (2016) and others. Because these few-shot evaluations of CLIP don’t make effective use of prior knowledge and the humans do, we speculate that finding a method to properly integrate prior knowledge into few-shot learning is an important step in algorithmic improvements to CLIP. To our knowledge, using a linear classifier on top of the features of a highquality pre-trained model is near state-of-the-art for few shot learning (Tian et al., 2020), which suggests that there is a gap between the best few-shot machine learning methods and human few-shot learning.

If we plot human accuracy vs CLIP’s zero shot accuracy (Figure 16), we see that the hardest problems for CLIP are also hard for humans. To the extent that errors are consistent, our hypothesis is that this is due to at least a two factors: noise in the dataset (including mislabeled images) and out of distribution images being hard for both humans and models.

## Data Overlap Analysis

A concern with pre-training on a very large internet dataset is unintentional overlap with downstream evals. This is important to investigate since, in a worst-case scenario, a complete copy of an evaluation dataset could leak into the pre-training dataset and invalidate the evaluation as a meaningful test of generalization. One option to prevent this is to identify and remove all duplicates before training a model. While this guarantees reporting true hold-out performance, it requires knowing all possible data which a model might be evaluated on ahead of time. This has the downside of limiting the scope of benchmarking and analysis. Adding a new evaluation would require an expensive re-train or risk reporting an un-quantified benefit due to overlap.

Instead, we document how much overlap occurs and how performance changes due to these overlaps. To do this, we use the following procedure:

1) For each evaluation dataset, we run a duplicate detector (see Appendix C) on its examples. We then manually inspect the found nearest neighbors and set a per dataset threshold to keep high precision while maximizing recall. Using this threshold, we then create two new subsets, Overlap, which contains all examples which have a similarity to a training example above the threshold, and Clean, which contains all examples that are below this threshold. We denote the unaltered full dataset All for reference. From this we first record the degree of data contamination as the ratio of the number of examples in Overlap to the size of All.

2) We then compute the zero-shot accuracy of CLIP RN50x64 on the three splits and report All - Clean as our main metric. This is the difference in accuracy due to contamination. When positive it is our estimate of how much the overall reported accuracy on the dataset was inflated by over-fitting to overlapping data.

3) The amount of overlap is often small so we also run a binomial significance test where we use the accuracy on Clean as the null hypothesis and compute the one-tailed (greater) p-value for the Overlap subset. We also calculate 99.5% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals on Dirty as another check.

A summary of this analysis is presented in Figure 17. Out of 35 datasets studied, 9 datasets have no detected overlap at all. Most of these datasets are synthetic or specialized making them unlikely to be posted as normal images on the internet (for instance MNIST, CLEVR, and GTSRB) or are guaranteed to have no overlap due to containing novel data from after the date our dataset was created (ObjectNet and Hateful Memes). This demonstrates our detector has a low-false positive rate which is important as false positives would under-estimate the effect of contamination in our analysis. There is a median overlap of 2.2% and an average overlap of 3.2%. Due to this small amount of overlap, overall accuracy is rarely shifted by more than 0.1% with only 7 datasets above this threshold. Of these, only 2 are statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. The max detected improvement is only 0.6% on Birdsnap which has the second largest overlap at 12.1%. The largest overlap is for Country211 at 21.5%. This is due to it being constructed out of YFCC100M, which our pre-training dataset contains a filtered subset of. Despite this large overlap there is only a 0.2% increase in accuracy on Country211. This may be because the training text accompanying an example is often not related to the specific task a downstream eval measures. Country211 measures geo-localization ability, but inspecting the training text for these duplicates showed they often do not mention the location of the image.

We are aware of two potential concerns with our analysis. First our detector is not perfect. While it achieves near 100% accuracy on its proxy training task and manual inspection + threshold tuning results in very high precision with good recall among the found nearest-neighbors, we can not tractably check its recall across 400 million examples. Another potential confounder of our analysis is that the underlying data distribution may shift between the Overlap and Clean subsets. For example, on Kinetics-700 many “overlaps” are in fact all black transition frames. This explains why Kinetics-700 has an apparent 20% accuracy drop on Overlap. We suspect more subtle distribution shifts likely exist. One possibility we noticed on CIFAR-100 is that, due to the very low resolution of its images, many duplicates were false positives of small objects such as birds or planes. Changes in accuracy could instead be due to changes in the class distribution or difficulty of the duplicates. Unfortunately, these distribution and difficulty shifts could also mask the effects of over-fitting.

However, these results closely follow the findings of similar duplicate analysis in previous work on large scale pretraining. Mahajan et al. (2018) and Kolesnikov et al. (2019) detected similar overlap rates and found minimal changes in overall performance. Importantly, Kolesnikov et al. (2019) also compared the alternative de-duplication strategy discussed in the introduction to this section with the approach we settled on and observed little difference between the two approaches.

## Limitations

There are still many limitations to CLIP. While several of these are discussed as part of analysis in various sections, we summarize and collect them here.

On datasets with training splits, the performance of zeroshot CLIP is on average competitive with the simple supervised baseline of a linear classifier on top of ResNet-50 features. On most of these datasets, the performance of this baseline is now well below the overall state of the art. Significant work is still needed to improve the task learning and transfer capabilities of CLIP. While scaling has so far steadily improved performance and suggests a route for continued improvement, we estimate around a 1000x increase in compute is required for zero-shot CLIP to reach overall state-of-the-art performance. This is infeasible to train with current hardware. Further research into improving upon the computational and data efficiency of CLIP will be necessary.

Analysis in Section 3.1 found that CLIP’s zero-shot performance is still quite weak on several kinds of tasks. When compared to task-specific models, the performance of CLIP is poor on several types of fine-grained classification such as differentiating models of cars, species of flowers, and variants of aircraft. CLIP also struggles with more abstract and systematic tasks such as counting the number of objects in an image. Finally for novel tasks which are unlikely to be included in CLIP’s pre-training dataset, such as classifying the distance to the nearest car in a photo, CLIP’s performance can be near random. We are confident that there are still many, many, tasks where CLIP’s zero-shot performance is near chance level.

While zero-shot CLIP generalizes well to many natural image distributions as investigated in Section 3.3, we’ve observed that zero-shot CLIP still generalizes poorly to data that is truly out-of-distribution for it. An illustrative example occurs for the task of OCR as reported in Appendix E. CLIP learns a high quality semantic OCR representation that performs well on digitally rendered text, which is common in its pre-training dataset, as evidenced by performance on Rendered SST2. However, CLIP only achieves 88% accuracy on the handwritten digits of MNIST. An embarrassingly simple baseline of logistic regression on raw pixels outperforms zero-shot CLIP. Both semantic and near-duplicate nearest-neighbor retrieval verify that there are almost no images that resemble MNIST digits in our pre-training dataset. This suggests CLIP does little to address the underlying problem of brittle generalization of deep learning models. Instead CLIP tries to circumvent the problem and hopes that by training on such a large and varied dataset that all data will be effectively in-distribution. This is a naive assumption that, as MNIST demonstrates, is easy to violate.

Although CLIP can flexibly generate zero-shot classifiers for a wide variety of tasks and datasets, CLIP is still limited to choosing from only those concepts in a given zero-shot classifier. This is a significant restriction compared to a truly flexible approach like image captioning which could generate novel outputs. Unfortunately, as described in Section 2.3 we found the computational efficiency of the image caption baseline we tried to be much lower than CLIP. A simple idea worth trying is joint training of a contrastive and generative objective with the hope of combining the efficiency of CLIP with the flexibility of a caption model. As another alternative, search could be performed at inference time over many natural language explanations of a given image, similar to approach proposed in Learning with Latent Language Andreas et al. (2017). CLIP also does not address the poor data efficiency of deep learning. Instead CLIP compensates by using a source of supervision that can be scaled to hundreds of millions of training examples. If every image seen during training of a CLIP model was presented at a rate of one per second, it would take 405 years to iterate through the 12.8 billion images seen over 32 training epochs. Combining CLIP with self-supervision (Henaff, 2020; Chen et al., 2020c) and self-training (Lee; Xie et al., 2020) methods is a promising direction given their demonstrated ability to improve data efficiency over standard supervised learning.

Our methodology has several significant limitations. Despite our focus on zero-shot transfer, we repeatedly queried performance on full validation sets to guide the development of CLIP. These validation sets often have thousands of examples, which is unrealistic for true zero-shot scenarios. Similar concerns have been raised in the field of semi-supervised learning (Oliver et al., 2018). Another potential issue is our selection of evaluation datasets. While we have reported results on Kornblith et al. (2019)’s 12 dataset evaluation suite as a standardized collection, our main results use a somewhat haphazardly assembled collection of 27 datasets that is undeniably co-adapted with the development and capabilities of CLIP. Creating a new benchmark of tasks designed explicitly to evaluate broad zero-shot transfer capabilities, rather than re-using existing supervised datasets, would help address these issues.

CLIP is trained on text paired with images on the internet. These image-text pairs are unfiltered and uncurated and result in CLIP models learning many social biases. This has been previously demonstrated for image caption models (Bhargava & Forsyth, 2019). We refer readers to Section 7 for detailed analysis and quantification of these behaviors for CLIP as well as discussion of potential mitigation strategies.

While we have emphasized throughout this work that specifying image classifiers through natural language is a flexible and general interface, it has its own limitations. Many complex tasks and visual concepts can be difficult to specify just through text. Actual training examples are undeniably useful but CLIP does not optimize for few-shot performance directly. In our work, we fall back to fitting linear classifiers on top of CLIP’s features. This results in a counter-intuitive drop in performance when transitioning from a zero-shot to a few-shot setting. As discussed in Section 4, this is notably different from human performance which shows a large increase from a zero to a one shot setting. Future work is needed to develop methods that combine CLIP’s strong zero-shot performance with efficient few-shot learning

## Broader Impacts

CLIP has a wide range of capabilities due to its ability to carry out arbitrary image classification tasks. One can give it images of cats and dogs and ask it to classify cats, or give it images taken in a department store and ask it to classify shoplifters–a task with significant social implications and for which AI may be unfit. Like any image classification system, CLIP’s performance and fitness for purpose need to be evaluated, and its broader impacts analyzed in context. CLIP also introduces a capability that will magnify and alter such issues: CLIP makes it possible to easily create your own classes for categorization (to ‘roll your own classifier’) without a need for re-training. This capability introduces challenges similar to those found in characterizing other, large-scale generative models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020); models that exhibit non-trivial zero-shot (or fewshot) generalization can have a vast range of capabilities, many of which are made clear only after testing for them.

Our studies of CLIP in a zero-shot setting show that the model displays significant promise for widely-applicable tasks like image retrieval or search. For example, it can find relevant images in a database given text, or relevant text given an image. Further, the relative ease of steering CLIP toward bespoke applications with little or no additional data or training could unlock a variety of novel applications that are hard for us to envision today, as has occurred with large language models over the past few years.

In addition to the more than 30 datasets studied in earlier sections of this paper, we evaluate CLIP’s performance on the FairFace benchmark and undertake exploratory bias probes. We then characterize the model’s performance in a downstream task, surveillance, and discuss its usefulness as compared with other available systems. Many of CLIP’s capabilities are omni-use in nature (e.g. OCR can be used to make scanned documents searchable, to power screen reading technologies, or to read license plates). Several of the capabilities measured, from action recognition, object classification, and geo-localization, to facial emotion recognition, can be used in surveillance. Given its social implications, we address this domain of use specifically in the Surveillance section.

We have also sought to characterize the social biases inherent to the model. Our bias tests represent our initial efforts to probe aspects of how the model responds in different scenarios, and are by nature limited in scope. CLIP and models like it will need to be analyzed in relation to their specific deployments to understand how bias manifests and identify potential interventions. Further community exploration will be required to develop broader, more contextual, and more robust testing schemes so that AI developers can better characterize biases in general purpose computer vision models.

### Bias

Algorithmic decisions, training data, and choices about how classes are defined and taxonomized (which we refer to informally as “class design”) can all contribute to and amplify social biases and inequalities resulting from the use of AI systems (Noble, 2018; Bechmann & Bowker, 2019; Bowker & Star, 2000). Class design is particularly relevant to models like CLIP, since any developer can define a class and the model will provide some result.

In this section, we provide preliminary analysis of some of the biases in CLIP, using bias probes inspired by those outlined in Buolamwini & Gebru (2018) and Karkk ¨ ainen ¨ & Joo (2019). We also conduct exploratory bias research intended to find specific examples of biases in the model, similar to that conducted by Solaiman et al. (2019).

We start by analyzing the performance of Zero-Shot CLIP on the face image dataset FairFace (Karkk ¨ ainen & Joo ¨ , 2019) 6 as an initial bias probe, then probe the model further to surface additional biases and sources of biases, including class design.

We evaluated two versions of CLIP on the FairFace dataset: a zero-shot CLIP model (“ZS CLIP”), and a logistic regression classifier fitted to FairFace’s dataset on top of CLIP’s features (“LR CLIP”). We find that LR CLIP gets higher accuracy on the FairFace dataset than both the ResNext-101 32x48d Instagram model (“Linear Probe Instagram”) (Mahajan et al., 2018) and FairFace’s own model on most of the classification tests we ran7 . ZS CLIP’s performance varies by category and is worse than that of FairFace’s model for a few categories, and better for others. (See Table 3 and Table 4). Additionally, we test the performance of the LR CLIP and ZS CLIP models across intersectional race and gender categories as they are defined in the FairFace dataset. We find that model performance on gender classification is above 95% for all race categories. Table 5 summarizes these results.

While LR CLIP achieves higher accuracy than the Linear Probe Instagram model on the FairFace benchmark dataset for gender, race and age classification of images by intersectional categories, accuracy on benchmarks offers only one approximation of algorithmic fairness, as Raji et al. (2020) have shown, and often fails as a meaningful measure of fairness in real world contexts. Even if a model has both higher accuracy and lower disparities in performance on different sub-groups, this does not mean it will have lower disparities in impact (Scheuerman et al., 2019). For example, higher performance on underrepresented groups might be used by a company to justify their use of facial recognition, and to then deploy it ways that affect demographic groups disproportionately. Our use of facial classification benchmarks to probe for biases is not intended to imply that facial classification is an unproblematic task, nor to endorse the use of race, age, or gender classification in deployed contexts.

We also probed the model using classification terms with high potential to cause representational harm, focusing on denigration harms in particular (Crawford, 2017). We carried out an experiment in which the ZS CLIP model was required to classify 10,000 images from the FairFace dataset. In addition to the FairFace classes, we added in the following classes: ‘animal’, ‘gorilla’, ‘chimpanzee’, ‘orangutan’, ‘thief’, ‘criminal’ and ‘suspicious person’. The goal of this experiment was to check if harms of denigration disproportionately impact certain demographic subgroups. We found that 4.9% (confidence intervals between 4.6% and 5.4%) of the images were misclassified into one of the non-human classes we used in our probes (‘animal’, ‘chimpanzee’, ‘gorilla’, ‘orangutan’). Out of these, ‘Black’ images had the highest misclassification rate (approximately 14%; confidence intervals between [12.6% and 16.4%]) while all other races had misclassification rates under 8%. People aged 0-20 years had the highest proportion being classified into this category at 14%.

We also found that 16.5% of male images were misclassified into classes related to crime (‘thief’, ‘suspicious person’ and ‘criminal’) as compared to 9.8% of female images. Interestingly, we found that people aged 0-20 years old were more likely to fall under these crime-related classes (approximately 18%) compared to images of people in different age ranges (approximately 12% for people aged 20-60 and 0% for people over 70). We found significant disparities in classifications across races for crime related terms, which is captured in Table 6.

Given that we observed that people under 20 were the most likely to be classified in both the crime-related and nonhuman animal categories, we carried out classification for the images with the same classes but with an additional category ‘child’ added to the categories. Our goal here was to see if this category would significantly change the behaviour of the model and shift how the denigration harms are distributed by age. We found that this drastically reduced the number of images of people under 20 classified in either crime-related categories or non-human animal categories (Table 7). This points to how class design has the potential to be a key factor determining both the model performance and the unwanted biases or behaviour the model may exhibit while also asks overarching questions about the use of face images to automatically classify people along such lines (y Arcas et al., 2017).

The results of these probes can change based on the class categories one chooses to include as well as the specific language one uses to describe each class. Poor class design can lead to poor real world performance; this concern is particularly relevant to a model like CLIP, given how easily developers can design their own classes.

We also carried out experiments similar to those outlined by Schwemmer et al. (2020) to test how CLIP treated images of men and women differently using images of Members of Congress. As part of these experiments, we studied how certain additional design decisions such as deciding thresholds for labels can impact the labels output by CLIP and how biases manifest.

We carried out three experiments - we tested for accuracy on gender classification and we tested for how labels were differentially distributed across two different label sets. For our first label set, we used a label set of 300 occupations and for our second label set we used a combined set of labels that Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Rekognition and Microsoft Azure Computer Vision returned for all the images.

We first simply looked into gender prediction performance of the model on the images of Members of Congress, in order to check to see if the model correctly recognized men as men and women as women given the image of a person who appeared to be in an official setting/position of power. We found that the model got 100% accuracy on the images. This is slightly better performance than the model’s performance on the FairFace dataset. We hypothesize that one of the reasons for this is that all the images in the Members of Congress dataset were high-quality and clear, with the people clearly centered, unlike those in the FairFace dataset.

In order to study how the biases in returned labels depend on the thresholds set for label probability, we did an experiment in which we set threshold values at 0.5% and 4.0%. We found that the lower threshold led to lower quality of labels. However, even the differing distributions of labels under this threshold can hold signals for bias. For example, we find that under the 0.5% threshold labels such as ‘nanny’ and ‘housekeeper’ start appearing for women whereas labels such as ‘prisoner’ and ‘mobster’ start appearing for men. This points to gendered associations similar to those that have previously been found for occupations (Schwemmer et al., 2020) (Nosek et al., 2002) (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).

At the higher 4% threshold, the labels with the highest probability across both genders include “lawmaker”, “legislator” and “congressman”. However, the presence of these biases amongst lower probability labels nonetheless point to larger questions about what ‘sufficiently’ safe behaviour may look like for deploying such systems.

When given the combined set of labels that Google Cloud Vision (GCV), Amazon Rekognition and Microsoft returned for all the images, similar to the biases Schwemmer et al. (2020) found in GCV systems, we found our system also disproportionately attached labels to do with hair and appearance in general to women more than men. For example, labels such as ‘brown hair’, ‘blonde’ and ‘blond’ appeared significantly more often for women. Additionally, CLIP attached some labels that described high status occupations disproportionately more often to men such as ‘executive’ and ‘doctor’. Out of the only four occupations that it attached more often to women, three were ‘newscaster’, ‘television presenter’ and ‘newsreader’ and the fourth was ‘Judge’. This is again similar to the biases found in GCV and points to historical gendered differences (Schwemmer et al., 2020).

Interestingly, when we lowered the threshold to 0.5% for this set of labels, we found that the labels disproportionately describing men also shifted to appearance oriented words such as ‘suit’, ‘tie’ and ‘necktie’ (Figure 18). Many occupation oriented words such as ‘military person’ and ‘executive’ - which were not used to describe images of women at the higher 4% threshold - were used for both men and women at the lower 0.5% threshold, which could have caused the change in labels for men. The reverse was not true. Descriptive words used to describe women were still uncommon amongst men.

Design decisions at every stage of building a model impact how biases manifest and this is especially true for CLIP given the flexibility it offers. In addition to choices about training data and model architecture, decisions about things like class designs and thresholding values can alter the labels a model outputs and as a result heighten or lower certain kinds of harm, such as those described by Crawford (2017). People designing and developing models and AI systems have considerable power. Decisions about things like class design are a key determiner not only of model performance, but also of how and in what contexts model biases manifest.

These experiments are not comprehensive. They illustrate potential issues stemming from class design and other sources of bias, and are intended to spark inquiry.

### Surveillance

We next sought to characterize model performance in relation to a downstream task for which there is significant societal sensitivity: surveillance. Our analysis aims to better embody the characterization approach described above and to help orient the research community towards the potential future impacts of increasingly general purpose computer vision models and aid the development of norms and checks around such systems. Our inclusion of surveillance is not intended to indicate enthusiasm for this domain - rather, we think surveillance is an important domain to try to make predictions about given its societal implications (Zuboff, 2015; Browne, 2015).

We measure the model’s performance on classification of images from CCTV cameras and zero-shot celebrity identification. We first tested model performance on low-resolution images captured from surveillance cameras (e.g. CCTV cameras). We used the VIRAT dataset (Oh et al., 2011) and data captured by Varadarajan & Odobez (2009), which both consist of real world outdoor scenes with non-actors.

Given CLIP’s flexible class construction, we tested 515 surveillance images captured from 12 different video sequences on self-constructed general classes for coarse and fine grained classification. Coarse classification required the model to correctly identify the main subject of the image (i.e. determine if the image was a picture of an empty parking lot, school campus, etc.). For fine-grained classification, the model had to choose between two options constructed to determine if the model could identify the presence/absence of smaller features in the image such as a person standing in the corner.

For coarse classification, we constructed the classes by handcaptioning the images ourselves to describe the contents of the image and there were always at least 6 options for the model to choose from. Additionally, we carried out a ‘stress test’ where the class set included at least one more caption for something that was ‘close’ to the image (for example, ‘parking lot with white car’ vs. ‘parking lot with red car’). We found that the model had a top-1 accuracy of 91.8% on the CCTV images for the initial evaluation. The accuracy dropped significantly to 51.1% for the second evaluation, with the model incorrectly choosing the ‘close’ answer 40.7% of the time.

For fine-grained detection, the zero-shot model performed poorly, with results near random. Note that this experiment was targeted only towards detecting the presence or absence of small objects in image sequences.

We also tested CLIP’s zero-shot performance for ‘in the wild’ identity detection using the CelebA dataset8 . We did this to evaluate the model’s performance for identity detection using just the publicly available data it was pre-trained on. While we tested this on a dataset of celebrities who have a larger number of images on the internet, we hypothesize that the number of images in the pre-training data needed for the model to associate faces with names will keep decreasing as models get more powerful (see Table 8), which has significant societal implications (Garvie, 2019). This

We found that the model had 59.2% top-1 accuracy out of 100 possible classes for ‘in the wild’ 8k celebrity images. However, this performance dropped to 43.3% when we increased our class sizes to 1k celebrity names. This performance is not competitive when compared to production level models such as Google’s Celebrity Recognition (Google). However, what makes these results noteworthy is that this analysis was done using only zero-shot identification capabilities based on names inferred from pre-training data - we didn’t use any additional task-specific dataset, and so the (relatively) strong results further indicate that before deploying multimodal models, people will need to carefully study them for behaviors in a given context and domain.

CLIP offers significant benefit for tasks that have relatively little data given its zero-shot capabilities. However, large datasets and high performing supervised models exist for many in-demand surveillance tasks such as facial recognition. As a result, CLIP’s comparative appeal for such uses is low. Additionally, CLIP is not designed for common surveillance-relevant tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. This means it has limited use for certain surveillance tasks when models that are designed with these uses in mind such as Detectron2 (Wu et al., 2019) are widely available

However, CLIP does unlock a certain aspect of usability given how it removes the need for training data. Thus, CLIP and similar models could enable bespoke, niche surveillance use cases for which no well-tailored models or datasets exist, and could lower the skill requirements to build such applications. As our experiments show, ZS CLIP displays nontrivial, but not exceptional, performance on a few surveillance relevant tasks today.

### Future Work

This preliminary analysis is intended to illustrate some of the challenges that general purpose computer vision models pose and to give a glimpse into their biases and impacts. We hope that this work motivates future research on the characterization of the capabilities, shortcomings, and biases of such models, and we are excited to engage with the research community on such questions.

We believe one good step forward is community exploration to further characterize the capabilities of models like CLIP and - crucially - identify application areas where they have promising performance and areas where they may have reduced performance9 . This process of characterization can help researchers increase the likelihood models are used beneficially by:

• Identifying potentially beneficial downstream uses of models early in the research process, enabling other researchers to think about applications.

• Surfacing tasks with significant sensitivity and a large set of societal stakeholders, which may call for intervention by policymakers.

• Better characterizing biases in models, alerting other researchers to areas of concern and areas for interventions.

• Creating suites of tests to evaluate systems like CLIP on, so we can better characterize model capabilities earlier in the development cycle.

• Identifying potential failure modes and areas for further work

We plan to contribute to this work, and hope this analysis provides some motivating examples for subsequent research.

## Related Work

Any model that leverages written, spoken, signed or any other form of human language as part of its training signal is arguably using natural language as a source of supervision. This is an admittedly extremely broad area and covers most work in the field of distributional semantics including topic models (Blei et al., 2003), word, sentence, and paragraph vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013; Kiros et al., 2015; Le & Mikolov, 2014), and language models (Bengio et al., 2003). It also includes much of the broader field of NLP that deals with predicting or modeling sequences of natural language in some way. Work in NLP intentionally leveraging natural language supervision in the form of explanations, feedback, instructions, and advice for tasks such as classification (as opposed to the commonly used representation of supervision as a set of arbitrarily encoded discrete category labels) has been explored in many creative and advanced ways. Dialog based learning (Weston, 2016; Li et al., 2016; Hancock et al., 2019) develops techniques to learn from interactive natural language feedback in dialog. Several papers have leveraged semantic parsing to convert natural language explanations into features (Srivastava et al., 2017) or additional training labels (Hancock et al., 2018). More recently, ExpBERT (Murty et al., 2020) uses feature representations produced by conditioning a deep contextual language model on natural language explanations and descriptions of relations to improve performance on the task of relation extraction.

CLIP is an example of using natural language as a training signal for learning about a domain other than language. In this context, the earliest use of the term natural language supervision that we are aware of is the work of Ramanathan et al. (2013) which showed that natural language descriptions could be used along side other sources of supervision to improve performance on the task of video event understanding. However, as mentioned in the introduction and approach section, methods of leveraging natural language descriptions in computer vision well predate the use of this specific term, especially for image retrieval (Mori et al., 1999) and object classification (Wang et al., 2009). Other early work leveraged tags (but not natural language) associated with images for the task of semantic segmentation (Barnard et al., 2003). More recently, He & Peng (2017) and Liang et al. (2020) demonstrated using natural language descriptions and explanations to improve fine-grained visual classification of birds. Others have investigated how grounded language can be used to improve visual representations and classifiers on the ShapeWorld dataset (Kuhnle & Copestake, 2017; Andreas et al., 2017; Mu et al., 2019). Finally, techniques which combine natural language with reinforcement learning environments (Narasimhan et al., 2015) have demonstrated exciting emergent behaviors such as systematically accomplishing zero-shot tasks (Hill et al., 2019).

CLIP’s pre-training task optimizes for text-image retrieval. This areas of research dates back to the mid-90s with the previously mentioned Mori et al. (1999) as representative of early work. While initial efforts focused primarily on predictive objectives over time research shifted towards learning joint multi-modal embedding spaces with techniques like kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis and various ranking objectives (Weston et al., 2010; Socher & Fei-Fei, 2010; Hodosh et al., 2013). Over time work explored many combinations of training objective, transfer, and more expressive models and steadily improved performance (Frome et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2014; Karpathy et al., 2014; Kiros et al., 2014; Faghri et al., 2017).

Other work has leveraged natural language supervision for domains other than images. Stroud et al. (2020) explores large scale representation learning by training a system to pair descriptive text with videos instead of images. Several works have explored using dense spoken natural language supervision for videos (Miech et al., 2019; 2020b). When considered together with CLIP, these works suggest that large scale natural language supervision is a promising way to learn high quality perceptual systems for many domains. Alayrac et al. (2020) extended this line of work to an additional modality by adding raw audio as an additional supervision source and demonstrated benefits from combining all three sources of supervision.

As part of our work on CLIP we also construct a new dataset of image-text pairs. Modern work on image-text retrieval has relied on a set of crowd-sourced sentence level image caption evaluation datasets like Pascal1K (Rashtchian et al., 2010), Flickr8K (Hodosh et al., 2013), and Flickr30K (Young et al., 2014). However, these datasets are still relatively small and limit achievable performance. Several methods have been proposed to create larger datasets automatically with Ordonez et al. (2011) as a notable early example. In the deep learning era, Mithun et al. (2018) demonstrated an additional set of (image, text) pairs collected from the internet could improve retrieval performance and several new automatically constructed datasets such as Conceptual Captions (Sharma et al., 2018), LAIT (Qi et al., 2020), and OCR-CC (Yang et al., 2020) have been created. However, these datasets still use significantly more aggressive filtering or are designed for a specific task such as OCR and as a result are still much smaller than WIT with between 1 and 10 million training examples.

A related idea to CLIP is webly supervised learning. This line of work queries image search engines to build image datasets by querying for terms and uses the queries as the labels for the returned images (Fergus et al., 2005). Classifiers trained on these large but noisily labeled datasets can be competitive with those trained on smaller carefully labeled datasets. These image-query pairs are also often used to improve performance on standard datasets as additional training data (Chen & Gupta, 2015). CLIP also uses search queries as part of its dataset creation process. However CLIP only uses full text sequences co-occuring with images as supervision rather than just the queries, which are often only a single word or short n-gram. We also restrict this step in CLIP to text only querying for sub-string matches while most webly supervised work uses standard image search engines which have their own complex retrieval and filtering pipelines that often involve computer vision systems. Of this line of work, Learning Everything about Anything: Webly-Supervised Visual Concept Learning (Divvala et al., 2014) has a notably similar ambition and goal as CLIP.

Finally, CLIP is related to a recent burst of activity on learning joint models of vision and language (Lu et al., 2019; Tan & Bansal, 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2020). This line of work focuses on richly connecting vision and language in order to solve complex downstream tasks such as visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, or multimodal entailment. These approaches leverage impressively engineered models which combine 3 (or more) pre-trained subsystems, typically an image feature model, a region proposal / object detection model, and a pre-trained masked language model such as BERT. These systems are then jointly fine-tuned via various training objectives on image-text pairs and applied to the aforementioned tasks and achieve impressive results. CLIP is instead focused on learning visual models from scratch via natural language supervision and does not densely connect the two domains with a joint attention model. The only interaction in a CLIP model between the image and text domain is a single dot product in a learned joint embedding space. We are excited to see CLIP hybridized with this line of work.

## Conclusion

We have investigated whether it is possible to transfer the success of task-agnostic web-scale pre-training in NLP to another domain. We find that adopting this formula results in similar behaviors emerging in the field of computer vision and discuss the social implications of this line of research. In order to optimize their training objective, CLIP models learn to perform a wide variety of tasks during pretraining. This task learning can then be leveraged via natural language prompting to enable zero-shot transfer to many existing datasets. At sufficient scale, the performance of this approach can be competitive with task-specific supervised models although there is still room for much improvement.
